David  Thomas started the event by thanking, SCP management team member Mike Evans for  organising the event, and in particular Clive Jewell for being the speaker. It  was through Clive’s invitation some eleven years ago that Safe Communities  attended a British consulate outreach program in Albufeira officiated by the  then British Ambassador Jill Gallard, where David announced the forming of Safe  Communities Algarve as it was then known, in response to the serious crime that  affected the Algarve at that time. Clive had continued to give great support to  SCP since then.  David then  spoke about how it was not until a year later that Safe Communities was  officially registered being the first crime prevention organisation registered  in Portugal. As interest and demand in its services grew it changed its name to  Safe Communities Portugal in 2014, taking on new challenges in the area of  civil protection including, in particular rural fire preparedness. The  association had held around 35 seminars at that time bringing the GNR, PSP,  SEF, Civil protection, Regional Tourism Algarve together before a foreign  community audience. The aim was develop public awareness of safety and security  risks and foster closer engagement between the community and the authorities.  He  explained how the association had been recognized by the government Council of  Ministers and had become a qualified Civil Protection Volunteer organisation  under Portuguese law. David added that these steps were essential in building a  close relationship with government and resulted in SCP being involved in parts  of the review process following the 2017 major fires. David gave an overview of  the considerable challenges the association face in dealing with Covid-19, its  current work in disaster risk reduction and covering major incidents as well as  plans for the future.  He concluded by thanking the management team,  members and followers. Clive  Jewell then gave a very interesting talk on what the day-to-day life of a Vice  Consul entails. He spoke about the core work of the consular team in supporting  the British community and the various services that they offered, as well as  his own role. There followed a number of questions.  David  Thomas said that this was the first of what they hope is a series of lunches  around the country. The event raised €465 in donations to SCP thank you.

d63afd23af73d93aec0123ae6e7583a4,"The Federation of Portuguese Agro-Food Industries (FIPA) has warned of the “serious situation” that the strike by workers in port administrations is causing to agri-food companies and calls for the parties to quickly reach a solution. At the same time, the Associação Empresarial de Portugal (AEP) sent a letter to the Government, warning of the consequences that the strike by port administration officials is already having on companies.“If it continues, the strike by port administration workers jeopardises the normal functioning of the agri-food industry, a sector for which the ports of the [Portuguese] Continent, Madeira and Azores are the gateway for raw materials into the country” , says FIPA in a statement.In addition, the stoppage ""compromises the export of goods"" and the ""meeting of delivery deadlines"" for orders, a situation that jeopardizes ""future relations with the outside world"".FIPA, however, recognizes that the “strike is a fundamental right of workers”, but warns of the fact that it is already “affecting the supply and consumption of essential goods”, as well as bringing “incalculable and lasting damage” to companies and their workers. And he continues: “The risk of disruption in the supply of some raw materials for food is already a reality”.Thus, and in view of the situation, and in case an immediate solution is not found for this labour dispute, FIPA understands that ""the minimum services must be reviewed and ensured immediately"", since they currently ""do not include the unloading of raw materials of essential food items”.The AEP is also concerned about the consequences of this  national strike. The association joined the Port Community of Leixões,  Commercial Association of Porto, Association of Shipping Agents of Portugal,  National Association of Port Terminal Concessionaires, Association of  Forwarders of Portugal, and Association of Port Operators of Leixões to alert  the Government to the damage being done to businesses and the economy.In a letter sent to the Government, the seven entities,  which manifest themselves as workers, operators, and customers of the Port of  Leixões, show great concern for the blockade that the import and export of  goods are causing.Users of national ports with greater capacity are already  diverting cargo to Spain and other international ports, but most economic operators  do not have that possibility and are currently paralysed. The situation is  particularly serious in the Port of Leixões, since its physical characteristics  dictate its total closure, without it being possible for ships to enter or  leave.“Port Administrations are profitable public companies. Every  year they distribute dividends to the State. However, port dues are not  ordinary income. The sector law says, very specifically, that they serve to  improve the port service, even though no relevant investments have been made in  the sector”, reads a statement.“It is the duty, obligation, and responsibility of the  Government to correct the application of these fees and the proper functioning  of the ports”, adds the AED. The National Union of Port Administration Workers (SNTAP)  called a multi-day strike, which began on December 22 and runs until January  30, covering ports on the mainland, Madeira, and the Azores. According to the  document sent to the Government, regional secretariats, and port  administrations, workers will be on strike ""from 00:00 on December 22nd  until 24:00 on December 23rd"", ""from 00:00 on December 27th until  24:00 of the 29th"" and ""of the 00:00 to 24:00 on the 2nd, 6th, 9th,  13th, 16th, 20th, 23rd, 27th and 30th of January”.Related article -  Port workers on strike",Port strike “affecting supply of essential goods”,https://www.theportugalnews.com/news/2022-12-30/port-strike-affecting-supply-of-essential-goods/73425,portugalnews,www.theportugalnews.com,7,514

e993ca0301367157d1d190d040fbdd3a,"I’ve recently read an article in the Guardian in which the  author debunked some assumptions  about the Real Estate broker profession in New York’s rental market. One  of the main assumptions mentioned was that the profession is very glamorous and is an easy way to make big financial gains without much  effort, especially in the luxury  market. The truth is, if we happen  to be in a sellers' market, as is  the case today, the situation appears  substantially different from what is expected by  the general public.  When  reading this article, I couldn't help but notice the similarities with what is  happening in the post-covid Portuguese market. With  the start of the pandemic in 2020, which lead to quarantine and the closing of  borders internationally, the Portuguese residential market shifted drastically.  In fact, countless numbers of properties, once dedicated to short-term rental,  were now listed as long-term properties – increasing the supply of the latter  on the market. This pushed housing prices down, benefiting buyers/tenants but only  momentarily. Then, at  the end of 2021 and  start of 2022, these  dynamics shifted again with demand exceeding supply significantly and housing  prices reaching all-time highs.   Anyone  who has tried recently to look for a property to rent in Lisbon’s  city center, certainly knows what I'm  talking about. By this I am not referring to a ground floor with an interior  bedroom in the Anjos neighborhood or a fourth-floor studio without an elevator  in Penha de França. If the reader wants to rent a prime apartment for his  family in the center of Lisbon today, he will be faced with a  true Odyssey that will be everything but Epic. The  market is once again on the side of the owners and it is  expected to remain as  such for a while, at least in the prime residential segment. According  to a study carried out by the Francisco Manuel dos Santos Foundation on the Portuguese real estate  market, the majority of the Portuguese population  favor purchasing a house over renting  one. The figures for private property sales have in fact grown significantly since 2011 while rental figures have been decreasing for the same period –  rental corresponding to only 19.9% of  the market ​​in Portuguese national territory. However, the main metropolitan areas – Lisbon and Porto – are  telling a different story, with the number of leases accounting  for 42.3% and 43.9% of  the market, respectively.  These figures are furthermore inflated  in the historic centers of  those respective cities, with 64.1% and 54.1% of  the market representing rental properties. Taking into consideration that Lisbon and Porto are the  cities with the highest demand for real estate, together with the fact that  they are the oldest cities in Portugal with dense historic centers and little to no space for new construction, it is only natural that the supply cannot keep up with the demand.  I  remember that on  multiple occasions during my realtor career in Lisbon, I  would meet with a potential landlord and after returning to the office to  prepare the new listing in the system, I would get a call from the same client  saying “the apartment had already been leased, we had an offer for the asking  price!” In a seller's market, there  are many daily challenges not only for those looking for a home but also for  those looking to work within the real estate industry. What consists of a seller’s market and what are the  challenges realtors face in such a market? In a seller’s market there is a decrease in inventory,  there are less houses in the market than buyers/tenants interested to buy. As  an increasing number of buyers are competing for the same pool of available  properties, their negotiation power decreases whereas the seller’s negotiation  power increases. Houses that have the characteristics most buyers are looking  for will spend less time in the market, which allows the seller to have more  leverage. As such, it becomes increasingly important for realtors in such a  competitive market to manage the seller/buyer relationship to a T.  With the decrease in the number of listings,  competitiveness amongst realtors for such listings will increase, as it is well  known in the real estate industry that the secret to any realtor’s success is  in the quality of their listings. Managing the relationship with the seller and  convincing them to sign a contract with you and not another realtor is of the  utmost importance. Buyer’s Market Vs. Seller’s Market: Expectations Vs.  Relationships management To be able to stand out and deliver in a seller’s  market, the realtor must understand the main drivers and differences within  these markets.  In my years of experience in real estate and business  development I have come to realize that there are two crucial elements for  succeeding in this profession: the way you manage expectations versus the way  you manage relations. In a buyer’s market the leverage of the seller is  decreased, thus it becomes increasingly important for the broker to manage the  “expectations” of  the seller. There are fewer buyers on the market than the houses available for  sale, hence the whole selling process becomes less emotional and much more  reasonable. Managing the sellers price expectations is a greater challenge in  such a market. Due to the competitiveness of properties for sale, buyers are  much more sensitive to price increases or drops of properties with very similar  characteristics as theirs.  On the other hand, on a seller’s market the sale  process is more emotional. With the scarcity of properties available for sale,  buyers are more prone to jump at the opportunity when they see one with the  characteristics they are looking for. In this type of market, the realtors need  to be acing up the buyer/seller relationships. They need enough perseverance to  look for off-market properties and be persuasive enough to get those niche  listings. In this type of market, the relationship with the sellers must be  managed carefully because sellers tend to be extremely demanding. In an  unregulated market, such as the Portuguese real estate market, it is not  unusual for the seller to back away from a settled agreement and sell to a  higher bidder. Hence, it’s also important for the realtor to communicate with  the buyer and prepare them to make an acceptable offer as fast as possible to  avoid losing opportunities to a quicker buyer.   by Sara Outeiro, ex Realtor and Business Development  Manager at EQTY Capital",Lisbon’s Prime housing market in 2022: Highs and lows of a Real Estate Agent in an owners’ market,https://www.theportugalnews.com/news/2022-12-02/lisbons-prime-housing-market-in-2022-highs-and-lows-of-a-real-estate-agent-in-an-owners-market/72615,portugalnews,www.theportugalnews.com,17,994

You could try joining a local sports team, or maybe a reading group  at the library.“Hobbies that involve groups are really beneficial,  helping build or strengthen friendships and improve communication skills,” says  MacLaren.A chance to switch offAnother big win for hobbies? They allow us the  opportunity to really switch off from work, chores, or caring responsibilities –  even just for a little while – and we need this.“If we don’t switch off from work, we can get into  very unhealthy patterns,” suggests MacLaren. “Overworking and work-related  stresses can become all-encompassing, dominating our thoughts and affecting  sleep, relationships, and motivation, eventually leading to fatigue and burnout.Credits: PA; Author: PA; “Hobbies are a great distraction from work,  providing an opportunity to engage in something you love, and giving a new  focus and renewed energy,” MacLaren continues. “They provide a sense of  achievement and accomplishment outside of the work environment and can be a  great boost to confidence and self-esteem. Having a break away from work can  also give time for the mind to rest, affording the opportunity to recharge. We  can find true happiness in our hobbies.”Fun ways to keep busy“While it’s important to give the mind and body  adequate rest, there are also huge advantages to keeping busy,” MacLaren notes.It’s not about running away from life’s  responsibilities – but sometimes a bit of healthy distraction can do us the  world of good, physically and mentally, as well as making us happier, more  rounded people. MacLaren suggests having hobbies can lead to “an  increase in productivity, organisation, motivation and mental alertness” as  well. “We may also find our creativity improving – dopamine-inducing activities  may help our brains think more creatively.”",Are hobbies the mental health saviour you need right now?,https://www.theportugalnews.com/news/2022-12-29/are-hobbies-the-mental-health-saviour-you-need-right-now/73414,portugalnews,www.theportugalnews.com,10,520

Among birds of prey, the most  frequent migrants are Booted Eagle, Sparrowhawk, Short-toed Snake-eagle, Common  and Honey Buzzards, Kestrel, and the rather impressive Griffon Vulture. However,  the peninsula is also deservedly famous as a hotspot for threatened, vagrant,  or rare species such as the Iberian Imperial Eagle (see also Cabranosa Birding  Hotspot).”“Cape St.  Vincent also offers excellent opportunities to observe a variety of seabirds.  Depending on the season, Balearic and Cory’s Shearwaters, Northern Gannets,  Scoters, Great and Pomarine Skuas, Parasitic Skuas, Razorbills, and even (luck  permitting) Grey Phalaropes can be relatively easy to identify from Cape St.  Vincent.”Credits: Unsplash; Author: Fabio Ballasina; Additionally,  Sagres hosts the largest birdwatching event in Portugal, which usually takes  place at the start of October.

c7f1547fb3cc63970e50fed24eca4757,"As  another U.S. income tax filing deadline passes, you may be coming to the  realization that your tax return didn’t include the many required U.S. forms  associated with international investments and assets: Portuguese bank and  investment accounts. Portuguese business interests. Investment or transfers  into non-U.S. investments. Fortunately, the IRS offers certain specialized  disclosure programs to U.S. persons depending on whether or not they live  inside the U.S.  One  such program is the Offshore Streamlined Program. A U.S. person who has not yet  been contacted or audited by the IRS may voluntarily submit themself through  this simplified program. Instead of going back to the beginning of time, this  program only requires that the U.S. person submit the previous three years of  income tax returns (assuming this is done post-April 15, 2022, this would be  for calendar years 2021, 2020, and 2019) and the previous six years of FBARs  (2016-2021).  As part of this submission, the U.S. person needs to explain  why they feel that they should qualify for no penalties. Generally, such a  ""reasonable cause"" defense is based on bad advice obtained from tax  professionals, but it also could arise in situations where the U.S. person left  the U.S. immediately after birth, while a child, was simply born outside the  U.S. without any connection to the U.S., hasn't had any connection to the U.S.  since, and had no way of knowing that they had a U.S. filing obligation. There  have been several recent cases, some conflicting, as to what constitutes  reasonable cause and how to compute a related penalty. The explanation  presented to the IRS through this process is very important and will be judged,  to a certain extent, subjectively.  Thus, if the individual at the IRS  reading the explanation doesn't like it, they could simply disqualify the use  of this special disclosure program and require the U.S. person to go through  the regular administrative tax submission process, which could be much longer. Some  people ask me if they could just relinquish their U.S. citizenship and avoid  this whole mess. There are two main problems with this approach. First, the IRS  has demonstrated that it is more than capable of freezing such a person's  non-U.S. accounts if it suspects tax evasion or certain degrees of willful  noncompliance. Second, the IRS may impose an exit tax on such  individuals.  Usually, the exit tax only applies if a person's global net  worth exceeds $2 million USD, but it also applies if a person cannot  affirmatively declare that they have been compliant with the previous five  years of U.S. tax filings.  If the exit tax is imposed, it essentially  treats the person as if they had liquidated their entire global estate, thereby  imposing a tax on the total gain, in excess of certain thresholds. Further,  such a person may never gift assets to other U.S. persons in the future without  subjecting such U.S. persons to a gift tax of about 40%. If you  are someone who needs to rectify your tax compliance, you will likely need to  work with an attorney and CPA to (1) understand your  overall ownership structure, noting that determinations as to the U.S.  treatment of entities and trusts will need to be made; (2) identify your annual  filing obligations based on your overall ownership structure; (3) identify your  missed and incomplete filings, along with their potential risks and penalties;  (4) identify solutions – the preferred type of reporting or disclosure program with  the IRS; and (5) engage in the chosen solution to rectify your compliance. Make  sure you engage professionals who have substantial experience working with  multi-national families and their tax needs.  by Severiano E.

6c35e0b63c419c8f2aaad1f1f4d28c60,"The  tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped below its 10,500 psychological support  level for the third time since October. This did not only happen because of  persistently growing interest rate hike worries, but also due to a poke in the  eye from the chipmaking sector. Many semiconductor producers’ stocks renewed  their price lows after the disappointing forecast delivered by Micron  Technology, a large producer of computer memory and data storage. Micron  announced on December 21 that it was going to suspend 2023 bonuses while also  reducing its headcount by nearly 10%, and that's the latest example of an  industry slowdown. A restructure plan ""in response to challenging industry  conditions” could require a $30 million charge and less investments in  manufacturing capacity and cost-cutting programs. Meanwhile,  many institutional experts are inclined to lower their estimates on tech  bellwether names battered by global demand woes, including corporate advertising  budgets. For instance, the analysts at Baird investment bank sharply cut its  2023 price targets on various internet stocks, including Amazon, Google-parent  Alphabet, as well as Facebook and Instagram owner Meta Platforms. New estimates  dropped to $120, $115, and $145 per share, respectively, which is somewhat  higher than the current prices, so that the group still remains bullish on  these mega caps over the medium-term prospect. Esperio analysts believe that a  similar outlook may concern companies, such as, Airbnb rent service, Alibaba  e-commerce platform, PayPal financial service, and many others.  The  recent FedEx stock bounce by 3.35% following the famous delivery company’s  quarterly report may partially revive hopes as it beat estimates. Yet, most of  the income was received due to cost-cutting measures. Therefore, FedEx charts have  remained deeply bearish for the last 18 months. The EPS (earnings per share) of  FedEx at $3.18 has been 12% higher than reported average Wall Street pool  expectations of $2.82. That was the effect after the company managed to find an  additional $1 bln due to cost savings from its overbuilt ground operations. This  could be considered to be somewhat of a playing defence strategy, or parking  the bus in terms of football tactics, and that is not bad for a weak team for a  period of time. Yet even a strong company may allow a stoppage-time goal  without having enough resource base and skills to attack. Amazon warned about  demand damage in the course of a challenging year, as the profitability is seen  to be disappearing because of much higher costs. The  revenue of Amazon for the financial year of 2022 could be close to $500 billion,  but the expected costs are also at nearly $500 billion. It means that there is  a high risk for the company to dive into negative territory in terms of profit within  the nearest couple of quarters. Flagship  retail delivery companies, including FedEx and Amazon, are quite important  barometers of global consumer sentiment. When they give out warning signs about  slowing demand, the investment community cannot just ignore them. So, we wish  much happiness for all buy-and-holders in the coming year, but there is hardly  any reason to fundamentally rely on it.

79434768b093305bfe9bf0b2f90cace4,"They’re edible herbs and roots that lend  themselves to a very Zen school of thinking called phytotherapy: where plants  are utilised for their healing abilities.Herbalists have long touted adaptogens like  ashwagandha, ginseng, liquorice root, holy basil, and cordyceps as a way to  bolster the adrenal system, which is responsible for releasing a range of  hormones into the body – including cortisol (the stress hormone linked with  weight gain, disrupted sleep, and reduced energy levels, plus bigger problems  like depression and anxiety). Now, the luxury holistic market is starting to  wake up to the healing power of these robust plants.“Adaptogens usually grow in very stressful  environments and have had to ‘adapt’ in order to flourish,” says Naomi Buff,  the health and wellness guru behind superfood brand Naomi’s Kitchen. “Maca, for  example, grows at a high altitude, whereas rhodiola is found in harsh,  mountainous terrains.“Their properties of greater resilience and  strength are transferred to us when we consume these nutrient-rich herbs and  roots, such as helping our bodies adapt to stress, whether it be physical,  mental, emotional or environmental.”Natural healingNaomi, who has created a very trendy blend of  herbal powders that can be added to smoothies, says adaptogens have been around  for millennia and were traditionally used  for natural healing in Chinese and Ayurvedic cultures. While an ancient man would have foraged for them in the ground, these days, wellness  junkies have a much easier job (you can whizz them up in shakes, take them in  tablet form or glug them on the go in cold-pressed juices and teas; Gwyneth  Paltrow and Donna Karan are reportedly fans).Adaptogens come in all shapes and sizes and  promise a host of different benefits – so how do you know which one is for you?  Naomi says ginseng is a universal winner: a blanket fixer adaptogen that can  lift the spirits and ward off colds and flu. Ashwaghanda, meanwhile, is the  go-to for easing anxiety (apparently it can suppress stimulatory hormones when  you’re strung out and stressed). Schisandra is a skin-nourishing woody vine  that’s great in winter; it can brighten the most lacklustre of complexions,  with, according to some fans, the added benefit of helping stave off seasonal  affective disorder. You might even improve your stamina in the bedroom with  maca, which Naomi describes as “nature’s Viagra”.It was during a period of extreme burnout,  four years ago, that Naomi first tuned into adaptogens as a way to treat her  own adrenal fatigue. “At the time, I was already working in wellness, teaching  nutritional cookery workshops in Monaco,” she says. “It wasn’t until my burnout  that I started to use adaptogens seriously and regularly. I included  ashwaganda, maca, reishi and rhodiola in powder form in my smoothies, and holy  basil in capsules.“These adaptogens really helped my recovery  and they’re now a staple in my diet when I feel exhausted.”She went on to create an adaptogen-based  superfood blend called ‘I Am Superman’, after seeing “hundreds of women” pass  through her nutritional cookery workshops and “constantly hearing them talk of  four common areas of concern: weight, skin, detox and energy”.There’s still limited scientific evidence  around adaptogens, but a quick scroll through internet forums shows a cult  following of devotees among the wellness brigade – namely praising them for the  ability to restore balance in the body and mind. It’s also piqued the attention  of Buddha bowl-loving Instagrammers; the hashtag #adaptogens has over 18,000  posts on the app.Credits: envato elements; Author: By leungchopan; Not for everyoneBut these potent plants might not be suitable  for everyone.“There are some groups of people who would be  considered unsuitable for using the adaptogens due to their stimulant effects  on the body, but also if they are taking any medications,” warns Dr. Sarah Brewer, a GP, and medical nutritionist.If you have high blood pressure or suffer  from heart problems or migraines, she suggests nixing ginseng from your  shopping list. Those prone to insomnia might also find the stimulant effect  keeps them awake at night, particularly if you take them late in the day  (imagine shotting an espresso just before bed). She also advises children and  women who are pregnant or breastfeeding to steer clear altogether.Before taking any kind of adaptogen, Dr. Brewer suggests you speak with your GP to check that they’re suitable for your  own medical needs.So now we know about them, and we’ve heard  what they can do, just one question remains: Do we actually need adaptogens as  part of our daily routine?“Having a well-balanced and healthy diet,  accompanied with exercise, would be ideal before supplementing, however  sometimes the therapeutic levels which may be recommended to help with ailments  such as stress, tiredness, and fatigue may not always be reached with diet  alone, and extra precautions may be needed,” says Hannah Moffitt, a  nutritionist at Holland & Barrett. “I would never tell someone they need to take  adaptogens,” says Naomi, “but I certainly believe in  their natural healing abilities and have experienced first-hand  how beneficial they [can be] for health.",What are adaptogens?

bb7154eade36da6db32036b062e5a57e,"The  fact that Mechano growth factor (MGF) has a short half-life and degrades within  a few minutes is one of the most significant issues with this substance. The  liver is the organ that typically produces it. After then, it enters the  bloodstream and continues its journey. Researchers  participated in various research intending to lengthen the half-life of Mechano  growth factor (MGF). During these investigations, MGF was separated and changed  by adding a chemical. Therefore, this event served as the starting point for  the Pegylated Mechano Growth Factor (PEG-MGF). What Exactly Is Pegylated Mechano Growth Factor? Insulin-like  growth factor 1 is a kind that has been shortened and modified into a molecule  known as pegylated mechano growth factor (PEG-MGF). According  to studies, PEG-MGF can enhance the proliferation of muscle cells. There is  some evidence to show that PEG-MGF may improve immune function concerning the  healing process. Compared to test subjects who do not take PEG-MGF, research  subjects who take it heal from wounds and other injuries more rapidly. What Is The Purpose Of PEG Mechano Growth Factor? Because  it stimulates the proliferation of muscle cells, PEG-MGF is administered to  research subjects who have had surgery to speed up their recovery from injuries  such as sprains and strains. Test  models are perpetually at risk for these injuries, requiring surgical  intervention. The process of mending, however, might take some time. Research  conducted on mice with injured muscles indicated that they healed quickly.  PEG-MGF is believed by experts to reduce the activity of some inflammatory  hormones and to lessen the effect of oxidative stress, hence protecting cells  over the long term. Other  advantages of using PEG-MGF include the following: Mending the Muscles of the Heart During  hypoxia, which is a situation that occurs when a body area is deprived of  oxygen, the cells in the heart muscle die. Peptides  such as PEG-MGF could attract stem cells to the injured cardiac muscles after a  heart attack, which would help with regeneration and recovery. There is still a  need for more investigation. Enhancing the Condition of Teeth Since  many years ago, PEG-MGF has also been used in several dental applications. The  peptide may boost the expression of MPP-1 and 2 in test subjects' periodontal  ligament cells, according to research conducted using those cells. It is also  possible to induce osteogenic differentiation, which repairs the ligaments that  bind the teeth to the bone and helps prevent further tooth loss. Once again,  comprehensive research is essential. Bone growth and repair  Osteoblasts,  the cells responsible for forming new bones, were shown to be boosted when the  peptide PEG-MGF was administered to rabbits with severe bone injuries. The  healing process takes just around four weeks to complete. Rabbits often need  six weeks to recover fully. Scientists utilize this information to investigate  the peptide's potential use in other bone-mending treatments. What is the Half-Life of PEG-MGF at the Current  Temperature? The  half-life of the Mechano-growth factor is only around five or seven minutes at  most. However, if polyethylene glycol, often known as PEG, is included in the  mix, its half-life may be up to 48 hours. There are situations when it takes up  to three days. That's lengthy. In  contrast to many other chemicals, PEG does not attach to other bodily  substances. Urination is the typical route of elimination for it. Injections  under the skin (subcutaneous) are another method of administration. Therefore,  researchers could require medical monitoring for novice animal subjects and  those with more expertise. Who Is This Intended For? MGF-PEG  may be an excellent choice for research subjects with medical disorders that  need soft tissue repairs, such as those who have had a heart attack, stroke,  sarcopenia, or any damage brought on by activity.

What is the pre-emption right? The pre-emption  right is regulated in the Civil Code, which defines it as the agreement by  which someone assumes the obligation to give preference to another in the sale  of a certain property.Besides the bond that results from the will of  the two parties, such as the buyer and seller, there are also situations in  which the law imposes the pre-emption right. In the case of the purchase and  sale process of your property, it is important to verify if the property is  located in a place where it is required the announcement in order to exercise  the pre-emption right.In this article, we will only address the  pre-emption rights, regarding rustic lands and the pre-emption rights of public  entities.Pre-emption rights regarding rustic lands: When  the sale regards a piece of land, which is classified and registered with the  Tax Authority as rustic land – Prédio Rústico -, your neighbours that  own other attached land have the pre-emption right to buy your land in relation  to third parties, but only if the total area of one of the lands is inferior to  the so-called unity of culture or crop unit, or if it is destined for another  purpose than agriculture. A crop unit is understood to be the minimum  area of rustic land so that it can be managed in a sustainable way, using the  normal and adequate means and resources to obtain a satisfactory result, taking  into account the characteristics of that land and the geographical,  agricultural and forestry characteristics of the area where it is located. It  is defined by the ordinance published in 19/2019, of January 15th, that the  crop unit - UMC - for the district of Faro land under irrigation is 2.5  hectares. Dryland land or forest land is 8 hectares. Therefore, if you intend to buy or sell rustic land, the UMC of your land has to be verified, as well as the bordering  land, to verify the legal obligation of the pre-emption right.Also, some public entities can exercise the  pre-emption right, such as the City Council, Autonomous Regions, and Government.  These public entities have priority in the purchase and sale of certain  properties, by the same terms, prices, and conditions agreed with another buyer,  i.e. they have the faculty to exercise the right of preference, in certain  situations:· Properties located in  areas of urban pressure;· Classified Properties  or in the process of classification;· Properties located in a  protected area;· Properties located in  urban rehabilitation areas;The announcement for the exercise of the  pre-emption legal right is an obligation of the seller. It can be placed online  by the owner of the property, or by the solicitor, and should indicate who  makes the request, identification of the seller and the buyer, identify the  property and respective location, the price of the purchase and sale, and  inform the foreseeable date of the sale.After placing the announcement, public entities  with the pre-emption legal right may express their intention to exercise this  right or not within a period of ten days. If they don’t do that, the owner may  proceed with the sale.

In the original story,  she says, our favourite wooden puppet hanged himself – although the final  chapter was quickly amended to make something more appealing to the public.Florentine author Carlo Lorenzini, who wrote under  the name Carlo Collodi, was a journalist and satirist commenting on the impacts  of Italy’s unification in the mid-19th century. But his tale of a marionette  who dreams of becoming a real boy inadvertently became a classic fairy tale.Happy ending or not, the city of Florence proudly  proclaims Pinocchio as one of its famous sons, alongside the likes of Dante and  Da Vinci. Shopfronts are stuffed with magnets, toys, and badges, while several  venues are named after key characters.Many of the original cafes and bookshops associated  with Collodi, who was born (and died) in the Tuscan city, no longer exist. But  it’s still possible to visit locations on a short tour with Claudia Durante.Besides, there are many more great reasons to visit  Florence. Here are a few of them.You can stay in a hotel with one of the city’s  oldest towersThought to be almost 1,300 years old, the Pagliazza  Tower is part of the luxurious Hotel Brunelleschi and now houses a gourmet  restaurant and museum, where there are also remains of a Roman Bath.

b1209f3ef38433afd4346553098baaf7,"Flossie was born in 1995 and has been recognised as  the world’s oldest living cat by Guinness World Records.The rehoming announcement marks a turnaround in  fortunes for Flossie, who was signed over to the Cats Protection charity in  Kent last year after her previous owner was no longer able to keep such an  elderly cat.She was given a new lease of life when the charity  matched her to a loving new home with Vicki Green of Orpington, who has  experience caring for older cats.Miss Green, who is 27 – the same age as her new pet  – said: “I knew from the start that Flossie was a special cat, but I didn’t  imagine I’d be sharing my home with a Guinness World Records title holder.“She’s so affectionate, playful and sweet,  especially when you remember how old she is. I’m immensely proud that Cats  Protection matched me with such an amazing cat.“She’s deaf and has failing eyesight but none of  that seems to bother her. She’s completely with it, loves affection and has a  very good appetite.“She never turns her nose up at the chance of a  good meal, except when she’s snuggled on her favourite yellow blanket.”Flossie had been living in a colony of stray cats  near a Merseyside hospital when two workers took pity on them and each homed a  cat in 1995.Her owner died after 10 years but Flossie was taken  in by her sister, where she stayed for another 14 years until the new owner  also died.For the next three years, Flossie lived with the  sister’s son, until his situation forced him to take his pet to Cats  Protection.Naomi Rosling, co-ordinator at the Tunbridge Wells,  Crowborough, and District branch which rehomed Flossie, said: “We were  flabbergasted when vet records showed Flossie to be nearly 27 years old.“She’s the oldest cat I’ve ever met, at least 120  in human years. If I’m in such good shape when I’m her age, with someone who  does what’s best for me when I need it most, I shall be a very happy lady.”Miss Green said Flossie has settled in well at her  new home.Miss Green’s previous cat Honeybun lived until the  age of 21, so she knew what to expect, and encourages more people to consider  adopting older cats.She added: “Older cats can need particular care and  being the oldest living cat, Flossie isn’t any different.“She sometimes misses her litter box or needs help  grooming herself, but I can help with all of that. We’re in this together.”Craig Glenday, editor-in-chief at Guinness World  Records, said: “We were so excited to hear about the lovely Flossie and  celebrate her long life – it’s not every day you come across a cat who has been  around since the mid-nineties. “This is the human equivalent of over 120 years  old, which would put her on par with Jeanne Calment, the French  supercentenarian who lived to 122 years 164 days and holds the record for the  oldest person ever”.",World’s oldest cat is same age as new owner at 27,https://www.theportugalnews.com/news/2022-11-24/worlds-oldest-cat-is-same-age-as-new-owner-at-27/72387,portugalnews,www.theportugalnews.com,10,466

932b581e35b86bc1d4098d97392baba8,"There  are two common options for saying Please: Por  favor or Se faz favor.  When it  comes to 'Thank you', men say Obrigado, and women say Obrigada. These are said to be leftover from an expression that went more or  less like, I am obliged (obrigado/a) to return the favour.  Because you are the  one feeling obliged, your thank you must reflect your own gender, not that of  the person you’re speaking to. That's why men end the word in o and women end  the word in a. This -o/-a switch is a common (but not foolproof!) pattern for  making words masculine or feminine in Portuguese. After  hearing an Obrigado / Obrigada, you have a few options for saying You’re  welcome. The most typical response is De  nada, which  literally means 'Of nothing'. It’s almost like saying you are obliged to nothing.   Here are  a few other alternatives and their approximate translations:Não tem de quê - There's no need to thank meCom certeza - Of course / Certainly / SureOra essa! - Oh, please!

Because vaccines were still  scarce worldwide, the first batch was intended for health professionals, who  were more exposed to Covid-19.Vaccines, also developed by other pharmaceutical companies,  would arrive regularly in the country, first for people from groups considered  to be a priority (such as the elderly, those with illnesses, or health  professionals, workers in homes, and essential services) then extended to  the entire population.

Thirdly, it is not clear that there would be an immediate and strong alternative to what exists”, maintained Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa.For the Head of State, “the country needs to take more advantages” than inconveniences from the dissolution of parliament, stressing that “experimentalism is not the best thing for democracies”.“We had elections not even a year ago, we can't have elections every year, we can't, every time there are ministerial reshuffles or team replacements, even if due to problems that are perhaps more sensitive to a part of public opinion or public opinion in general, to be resorting to dissolution”, he defended.Chefe do Estado disse duvidar que uma solução saída de novas eleições fosse mais estável do que a atual maioria absoluta do PS https://t.co/bOXJpgGxRN— CNN Portugal (@cnnportugal) December 30, 2022",President rules out snap election,https://www.theportugalnews.com/news/2022-12-30/president-rules-out-snap-election/73443,portugalnews,www.theportugalnews.com,5,259

In June, she was nominated by the Government for  the presidency of Navegação Aérea de Portugal (NAV) and at the end of the year  chosen as Secretary of State for the Treasury.The compensation to Alexandra Reis has been criticized in  recent days by all the opposition and even questioned by the President of the  Republic, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, when he said that “there are those who  think” that it would be “beautiful” for the Secretary of State to waive the  amount.

6118e8693f18d8768f32ab844ad48bc0," However, this is not what we are  seeing here. Demand and sales volumes are higher than ever. It makes one think  how these global trends once again are impacting us so little here in the  Golden Triangle? Perhaps it´s the  weather, the golf, the dreamy beaches and the quality of life that has  attracted so many people from all over the world to invest in this small  paradise. Or is it the fact that Portugal is considered to be one of the very  safest places to live on earth?  Perhaps it’s the  favourable tax regime or the Golden Visa scheme that has attracted so many.  There has been huge pent-up demand coming through following the lifting of  pandemic-related travel restrictions. Buyers seeking a better quality of life  and a new home away from home. Brexit might have contributed - many of our  British buyers preferred to invest their pounds in the EU and reduce their  currency risk. The stats below  speak for themselves:Year-to-date, we at  QP Savills, have agreed 72 sales, making it a record year following on from our  previous record in 2021. Total sales volume sits just shy of 200 million euros. Year on year we  witnessed a 23% increase in enquiries.  Our resort offices  in Quinta do Lago and Vale do Lobo have agreed 47 sales consisting of 162  million euros worth of property, making our average price per unit 3,463,000  euros. Our country office,  located in Loulé, has agreed 25 sales so far consisting of 33 million euros  worth of property, making our average price per unit there 1,460,000 euros. Interestingly,  unlike the rest of Portugal, the vast majority of our buyers are still British  and Irish which account for 71% of our total sales. They are followed by the  French and Belgians, the Germans, and then the Portuguese who tend to buy more  in the countryside.  This year total  global wealth grew by 9.8% and there were 5,200,000 new millionaires. These  High Net Worth Individuals are driving our market and seem unperturbed by the  increasing interest rates, rather choosing to place their wealth in euros and  Algarvian real estate. As with previous years, only a small percentage of our  buyers required a mortgage, the vast majority being cash buyers. Many are  digital nomads who are flocking to this sunniest region of Europe to invest in  permanent homes rather than just holiday homes.  We continue to see  an influx of younger families relocating here looking for a safe environment in  which their children can grow. International schools are struggling to cope  with the demand for places which has resulted in long waiting lists and some  schools have doubled in size to accommodate demand. There seems to be a  strong preference for purchasing finished properties or those that need  refurbishment over plots of land to build from scratch. This is probably  because construction costs have increased considerably (official figures say  there is a 12.5% increase nationally although this figure is likely higher) and  the lengthy process of getting plans approved seems daunting for many. Year after year  we´ve witnessed an increase in the number of valuation appointments and an  increase in properties coming to the market by around 10%. Some sellers prefer  an off-market approach so we have access to more unofficial listings than  before. We’ve noticed  stronger buyer interest in developments than ever before. The investment  opportunity and the quest to “get in early” to benefit from future price  uplifts are attractive. So much so that we are opening a new branch of the  business: QP Resorts and  Developments, Consultancy, and Sales - will be run from our already rebranded  offices located at the entrance of Vale do Lobo. Watch this space! The Golden Visa  programme is as popular as ever with more than 11,000 people applying since its  inception in 2012. This equates to six billion euros worth of property sales.  There is talk of the government making changes to the scheme and perhaps even  ending it, so if you are interested in obtaining a Golden Visa then we would  advise moving fast. We still have some options available here on the coast so  do call one of our Special Agents for details.  The Non-Habitual Tax  regime (NHR) continues to be hugely popular with over 11,000 non-habitual tax  residents so far taking advantage of this attractive initiative for those  looking to optimise their tax planning and reside in Portugal.   A new stream of  demand is emerging with the arrival of the Americans who are coming to Portugal  with their strong US dollars. In the States, Portugal is seen as being very  trendy and perceived to have a lifestyle comparable to that of California and  Florida. They have already found Porto and Lisbon and are now beginning to  discover the Algarve. According to SEF (The Portuguese immigration office),  over 7,000 Americans are now making Portugal their permanent home. Many from  the west coast are choosing to relocate and consider the Algarve to be the  ‘California of Europe’. The east coast Americans and Canadians migrate in the  winter months to our temperate climate. We have been a  Savills associate for over 25 years now and our partnership continues to grow.  It not only gives us access to their global network of over 700 offices but  also insight into their global research.  According to the  recent Savills Market Sentiment report, there seems to be a slowing of growth  after the post-pandemic boom. Buyer sentiment seems to be one of caution due to  the current uncertainty of the markets. It reports that an average of  two-thirds of their buyers were searching for properties in resorts, coastal,  or countryside locations, demonstrating that the search for space continues unabated.  The past year has seen global property markets benefit significantly from the  race for space and many government incentives designed to boost home sales.  This activity has increased property values worldwide. Here at QP, we’ve  been extremely busy: we hired half a dozen more sales agents and admin staff to  be able to maintain the standards of service that continue to make us your Best  Sellers. We have big plans to expand our business and our team further as we are  confident of continued growth, and have exciting ideas to grow geographically  in key areas as well as into property management and rentals.  We are now 100%  mobile ready, we have invested in a new innovative CRM system and have moved  all our servers onto the cloud so that our Special Agents have access to all  the data at the tip of their fingers. Our clients’ data is now safer than ever,  and soon our clients will be able to access data about their property in  real-time from when we send out their property details to feedback on viewings. We have just  launched a new marketing campaign in the USA and have meetings in LA early next  year to strengthen our American network. QP continues to  actively cut down our carbon footprint by reducing our use of paper and progressively  phasing out physical brochures to digital ones. We have invested in a fleet of  new 100% electric vehicles so that we stay at the forefront not only of new  technologies but also of environmental sustainability. So, once again we  here at QP have had another incredible year! As we write this on a sunny  December afternoon, we are so grateful to all our agents, admin staff, buyers,  sellers, and everyone else who have supported us over the past 25 years in  making QP what it is today, the leading real estate agents in the Algarve.

76771f2019140004aaca0702ffa6848c,"In America, the great ‘South-East Migration’  is often spoken about. Families, couples, and individuals from the East and  West coast are moving to states such as Tennessee, the Carolinas, and to an  extent Texas and Florida. The reasons behind the move: Lifestyle,  affordability, climate, taxes, and easier access to healthcare and schooling.  Essentially areas where pull factors far outweigh push factors. Sound familiar?   When speaking to investors from America about  why they are looking at Portugal for investment or residence, the same reasons  are highlighted and appreciated on this side of the Atlantic. The American  population in Portugal grew 45% in 2021. Importantly, the qualities drawing the  crowd are desirable at a time of abundance or financial challenges.  Cities like Atlanta, Dallas, Raleigh, Austin, and San Antonio have been benefactors, in recent years, of significant inflows  which have impacted the cities’ real estate markets positively, bringing much  interest from single-family and multi-family developers. However, the city many feel to be leading the  charge currently in Nashville. According to a report from leading consulting firm PwC produced for  Urban Land Institute Organization (ULI), Nashville secured the title of best overall prospect for real estate  investors heading into next year. In fact, it is the first metropolitan area  since San Francisco in 2014 to repeat the top ranking in the annual report. ULI’s  report for 2023 is based on direct interviews with more than 2,000 real estate  professionals across the US, regarding  the markets they consider the best overall for investment in the coming year. A  third of those in the survey are private property owners or real estate  developers.Knowing  that cities like Nashville are desirable for workers, it is unsurprising that the  E-commerce giant, Amazon, is establishing its second office there as an operations center, aiming  to employ at least 5,000 people. Over 100 families a day are  moving to Nashville.Furthermore,  Austin-based software giant Oracle  is building a substantial campus near downtown Nashville, looking  to employ 8,000 people in  high-paying tech jobs. Nashville apartment sales this year have surpassed last  year’s record of $4.22 billion to more than $4.4 billion. Once again, this replicates  Lisbon, where tech companies are taking advantage of the well-qualified local  population, as well as the fact that digital nomads happily call Lisbon ‘home’.  Lisbon’s ‘start-up’ scene is up with the most exciting in Europe. What  Lisbon and Nashville of course must monitor is the rate of growth. Issues such  as living  costs, traffic, housing affordability, and infrastructure quality  are regional disadvantages that came up frequently in such booming markets. That said,  at the end of the day, whether you prefer country music or Fado, these cities  both offer exceptional quality, diversity, and opportunity.  by Michael Maxwell, Head of Business Development at EQTY Capital ","Nashville, Lisbon’s unlikely American ‘Twin’",https://www.theportugalnews.com/news/2022-11-17/nashville-lisbons-unlikely-american-twin/72142,portugalnews,www.theportugalnews.com,6,425

But let us take  all of this off the table and look at the numbers and facts which paint an  equally attractive picture. In recent years the city of Porto, has experienced  a massive boom in its hotel development, office space, and residential sectors.  While prime office rent has remained stable, the market take-up for this sector  has increased to 24,470 m2 in Q2 2022, representing a +137%  y-o-y growth. As well, the hotel pipeline for 2022 has resumed its course and  with the significant increase in tourism, since the easing of health and travel  restrictions, the hotel investment volume in the country has picked-up with an  estimated €22.5 billion for the year, representing a 60% increase from 2021.  With approximately 1000 refurbished rooms completed in 2021 and an additional  1600 new rooms expected in 2022, Porto is undergoing major refurbishment, and  is adapting to the rise in popularity the city is experiencing.  With the increase in investment pouring into the  city, housing refurbishment has kept developers busy. We observe that Porto is  surpassing Lisbon in terms of licensing approvals, allowing for greater supply  of new residential projects and lower comparative housing prices on average.  Although real estate prices are lower in Porto than in the capital city, JLL  market pulse for Q2, 2022 reports that y-o-y average sales price for both  pre-existing building and new constructions are at record highs with more than  10% increase in both market segments.  International investors and digital nomads are not  the only ones being attracted to Portugal and all that it has to offer. Indeed,  students from all over the world are also drawn to the Southern European  country to pursue higher education levels, due to the country's reputation for  its great student/life balance. According to JLL market research, in the last 5  years Portugal has seen the number of international students increase by 55%, which  represents 14% of the total number of students in the country. As such, with  the increase in national and international students enrolling in Portuguese  universities that offer English programs, the student housing portion of the  market is expected to experience significant growth in the years to come. Increase in demand is enhanced further by a natural  northern migration from Portuguese citizens seeking a more affordable  lifestyle, housing market and school system. Porto offers this and more.  With fast increasing tourism, international  residents like digital nomads, students, relocating Portuguese and corporate  headquarters, Porto’s continued ascendency seems inevitable.

Another reason that absorbs 25% of complaints is related to the support  provided due to Covid-19.At SEF, most complaints (63%) point to problems with  renewing the residence permit as the reason. Difficulties in answering the  phone to schedule visits to SEF account for 35% of complaints.With regard to TA, problems with the IBAN (due to  extraordinary support from the State), generated 47% of complaints directed to  finance and the delay with IRS reimbursement represents 32% of complaints.Addressed to Lisbon City Council, two complaints stood out  this year: parking fines (29%) and problems with garbage collection (22%).At the IRN, there were three main reasons for  dissatisfaction reported: problems in obtaining the citizen's card (27%), poor  service (24%), and difficulties in renewing the passport (8%). At the IEFP, the  delay in approving professional internships was the reason that generated the  most complaints: 32%.

09e33919ace3a05f0e64a04a94001166,"In the last quarter of 2021 the financial  advisory firm, Dunstan Thomas, continued its trilogy of  generational studies focusing on long-term savings levels  and expectations of retirement for those who would be deemed: Millennials,  Generation Xers and Baby Boomers. Some startling facts emerged from Dunstan  Thomas’ consumer study on Baby Boomers, such that individuals aged between  59-76 are controlling nearly 80 percent of the UK’s private wealth in 2022,  that is trillions of pounds held in pensions for Baby Boomers, along with  property and other savings and investments. However, the report notes as well  that most UK Boomers are delaying their retirement in order to assist other  family members. As a result, a substantial majority of this population will be  over 70 years old when they retire, and plan on supporting their  children financially for at least five years into retirement. An equally concerning issue involves the  potential cost of care crisis in the UK. Despite increasing property prices,  reports from experts suggest that older individuals may lose as much as 56% of  the value of their home as a result of rising care costs. As well, the cost of  care homes is also increasing, reaching as much as 50% of the average property  value in some areas of the UK. According to TakingCare, a subsidiary of Axa  Health, these factors are boosted by the rising cost of living in the country,  increasing energy prices, and staff shortages, with the burden mostly being  felt by older Boomers and their children. Indeed, we should note that  first-time buyers, namely the Millennial generation, are also affected by the  care crisis. According to Savills research, half of first-time home buyers will  require financial help from their parents for the payment of their house  deposit in the next three years. However, retirement income is getting thinner, and retired Boomers are depleting available savings faster due to increasing  costs of care and living. As such, the financial help children may receive in  subsequent years will eventually grow thinner.The financial support Boomers are providing  their children and grandchildren, combined with an increasing life expectancy  and a higher cost of care, is resulting in a shift in the stream of  intergenerational wealth transfer for many families. Pre-emptive wealth  management and retirement planning is thus essential in avoiding stress related  to the increasing costs attributed with aging. In the past, retirement and wealth  planning involved the creation of a family trust and ensuring suitable levels  of capital deployed between generations in order to minimise taxes accordingly.  Today, with a higher marginal tax rate on wealth transfer and income in the UK,  it is time to rethink this financial planning strategy. Instead of exporting  the capital, it is time to export the family and future generations to  countries with attractive taxation schemes providing greater financial freedom.  At Émigré, we have assisted hundreds of clients in both relocation and other  tax efficient relocation strategies, by working with quality advisors. Our role  is always to act for the buyer, not the seller.  by Mark Penney, Consultant at Émigré LDA",A Possible Financial Storm on the UK Horizon,https://www.theportugalnews.com/news/2022-11-30/a-possible-financial-storm-on-the-uk-horizon/72557,portugalnews,www.theportugalnews.com,8,477

The ranking is based on three criteria, namely quantity,  quality, and the business environment.In total, there are seven Portuguese cities on the list of  the thousand best in the world, but despite the classification, all Portuguese  cities lost places in the world ranking from 2021 to 2022, with the exception  of Coimbra and Leiria. Lisbon continues to lead the national podium with the  largest margin, despite having lost a place, with the “startups ecosystem in  Lisbon” standing out for its marketing and sales, says HelloSafe.

87994f03d1ff217071989ba84da895b9,"Terra  Classic’s (LUNC) price boost is attributed to Binance Airdrops, but the  long-term outlook remains uncertainWhile it is impressive for any cryptocurrency to outperform the top 100  assets by market capitalization, it is worth noting that many of these top 100  assets are currently experiencing losses. Thus, Terra Classic’s (LUNC) recent  rise in value may not be as impressive as it appears. Additionally, the rise in  Terra Classic’s (LUNC) value is largely attributed to Binance's announcement of  the second round of LUNA airdrops to eligible users. This type of price  movement, driven by news and announcements rather than underlying fundamental  value, can be unsustainable in the long run. Furthermore, Terra Classic (LUNC)  has faced its fair share of struggles in the past. The collapse of the Terra  ecosystem in May led to the rebranding of the old Terra chain as Terra Classic  (LUNC) and the introduction of tokens LUNC and USTC. The subsequent proposal of  a new LUNA token airdrop by Terra Rebirth may have provided some temporary  relief for affected users, but it remains to be seen if Terra Classic (LUNC)  can sustain its current performance in the long term.Shiba Inu (SHIB) struggles with price drops despite burn rate increaseShiba Inu (SHIB) has also been making waves in the crypto community  recently, but for a different reason. The burn rate of Shiba Inu (SHIB) has  spiked significantly, with the Shibburn tracker website recording a jump of  over 642% in the past day alone. A total of 28,191,662 SHIB have been burned so  far, with 24,091,662 SHIB transferred to a dead-end wallet in a single  transfer. While the burn rate of Shiba Inu (SHIB) has certainly caught the  attention of many, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has also faced its fair share of struggles  and price drops. In fact, the equivalent value of the overall amount burned so  far is just a little over $233. The all-time high of Shiba Inu (SHIB) is  $0.000032, and it is currently trading at $0.000008. It is unclear if Shiba Inu  (SHIB) will be able to recover and maintain its value in the long term.Snowfall Protocol (SNW) sees an impressive price increase ahead of the  official launchThe crypto community has been buzzing with excitement over the  impressive performance of Snowfall Protocol (SNW) in recent weeks. Since  the first round of token sales began, the  price of SNW has soared from $0.005 to $0.14 today, a clear sign of market  acceptance and investor confidence. One of the main reasons for the Snowfall  Protocol (SNW) success is its unique  interoperability model, which allows it to seamlessly connect with various  blockchain platforms. This has clearly struck a chord with investors, as the second round of SNW token sales sold out a day early following the release of the dApp prototype. The  round also closed at an impressive $3  million raise. But Snowfall Protocol's (SNW) strong performance hasn't stopped  there. The third round of token sales has continued to impress, with the  official launch of SNW set for January at a price of $0.2 if all tokens sell out – a likely scenario given the  current level of demand. It's no surprise that the crypto world is keeping a  close eye on Snowfall  Protocol (SNW), and with such a promising start, it will be  interesting to see how Snowfall Protocol (SNW) continues to perform  in the future.ConclusionOverall, it is important to carefully consider the performance and  underlying fundamentals of any cryptocurrency asset before making an  investment. While Terra Classic (LUNC) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have both faced  challenges, Snowfall  Protocol (SNW) has demonstrated strong performance and stability  recently.

65061122995bee3b0d689907b1b1fec4,"Among the  improvements that the 16/2022 law will bring to consumers' lives, DECO  highlights the implementation of fairer rules for calculating the compensation  to be paid by the consumer in the event of early termination of the contract  during the mandatory period. In  addition, the new law has a new set of rules when it comes to changes of  address, unemployment, and emigration and it also brings a different way of  calculating the compensation to be paid in case of unblocking equipment. Regarding  early termination of the contract during the mandatory period, the way in which  termination costs are calculated has been changed. However, DECO still states  that ""it remains confusing and insufficient to encourage mobility in this  sector"". The law says that the payment of charges can only be claimed if  fixed in the contract and has to be based on the actual costs.  In case of  unemployment, long-term illness, or emigration, there is a new measure  ""long requested by DECO"" that establishes that communication  companies cannot require the consumer who has a contract to pay any charges  related to the breach of the mandatory period if the consumer is unemployed, is  suffering from a long-term illness or has emigrated. However, this unemployment  situation cannot be the consumer's fault and must lead to a loss of their  monthly budget. There is  also a ban on charging exit costs in situations of permanent or temporary  incapacity for work lasting more than 60 days, particularly in the case of  illness, which involves a loss of the consumer's available monthly income. With  regard to change of residence, situations of unemployment, disability/prolonged  illness or emigration, it is now established that operators may not require the  consumer holding the contract to pay any charges related to the breach of the  mandatory deadline if they are in one of the situations mentioned above. Still work  to be done DECO  argues that the law could have gone even further in several aspects, such as in  the further reduction of early termination costs, during the mandatory period,  in order to allow consumers to change of communication operators or the  prohibition of automatic charges for additional consumption or extra services  from the operator.

7785467b73563a6aac134ad68ef1af66,"While  the popularity of trains has undeniably increased, there are problems that  remain for travelers, as public transport is still not designed to be inclusive for people with reduced mobility.For  a person with reduced mobility, every day can be a challenge, from steps to  inaccessible public transports. In this regard, we had feedback from Dr. Andy  Thompson, who is a retired doctor from the UK, where he also worked as a  coroner. Dr. Andy always led a very active life, until he was forced into early retirement  due to a stroke that caused side effects on the right side of his body and made  him dependent on an electric wheelchair. In 2020 he moved to Portugal, where he  always dreamed of retiring to. Not  meeting needsHe  lived in Coimbra for some time, but then moved to Leiria, where he found a good  school for his stepdaughter in a neighbouring municipality. However, although  he is very happy with the city itself, he says that public transport in Leiria  does not meet the needs of the population, especially when it comes to people  with reduced mobility. “The  local buses system doesn’t have any coordination with the next town. The  municipality of Leiria has no coordination with the municipality of Pombal or  Marinha Grande. As for the longer distance buses, it’s not easy, because you’ve  to lift the wheelchair. First of all, the driver has to be happy that you’re  going to put this heavy wheelchair in the luggage place, then he has to help.  So it’s not so easy”, he told me.Also,  local trains can be really complicated. ""The local ones, I haven't even  tried. The reason I don't try is because I can't get any guarantee in advance  that there will be someone to help me lift my wheelchair onto the train because  it's a long vertical step of a metre,"" he said.  Dr. Andy has a converted car with a left-foot accelerator. ""Most of the time we  go by car when we travel long distances or even when we travel short  distances"", because public transport is not easy enough.  However, he  is a big supporter of public transport, particularly trains, in order to  mitigate climate change and address the lack of population density in small  areas of Portugal.Railway  plans for PortugalPortugal  recently launched a plan for 2030 on trains. The document of over 70 pages is  currently under public consultation. However, there is nothing in it about  passengers with reduced mobility. “The  whole purpose of my response to the rail plan is that there is nothing in that  plan for people who are dependent on wheelchairs or have other mobility  problems or disabilities. There is no statement of intent to improve rail  experiences for disabled people”, he told The Portugal News.In  addition, timetabling is also a problem that needs to be addressed. ""I  am not saying they should throw away the plan, because the plan has some good  things too, but it has to be improved. They talk about some good ideas, but I  think it is not imaginative enough. It focuses a lot on the big prestige  upgrade of the high-speed network and talks only a little bit about  timetabling,"" he said.""When  you look at this area in Leiria, you can't be a tourist in this region if you  don't have a car. I can't get to the next municipality. There's no bus from  here to Pombal, there's no train and it's a 20-minute journey,"" he added. In  terms of suggestions, he said that ""they could introduce on-platform ramps  for a particular carriage on the train. The ramp could be on the platform and  then when it is needed it would be there. It doesn't involve any work by the  train staff, it doesn't involve any work by the station staff, it's just an  extension of the platform that allows access to the carriage without any steps  and that's not an expensive option.""Good  exampleThe  good news is that while local trains can get really tricky, the Alfa Pendular  (long-distance train) stands out as a fantastic train for literally everyone.""The  whole booking process as well as the wheelchair lift is very easy. It's a  fantastic service. I've travelled a lot in Europe and I think the Alfa Pendular  is the best service of its kind I've come across for disabled people.

In this article, we  will discuss how Snowfall Protocol (SNW) is leading the charge in the crypto  market.Experts urge investors to sell Dogecoin (DOGE) due to the lack of use  cases and limitationsElon Musk's recent announcement that he is willing to talk to the  Dogecoin DOGE) army via Twitter Spaces has caused a stir in the crypto world.  While some have hailed this as a positive development for Dogecoin (DOGE),  others have expressed skepticism. One of the main concerns surrounding Dogecoin  (COIN) is its lack of use cases and limitations. Dogecoin's (DOGE) blockchain  is unable to interact with smart contracts, which are the building blocks of  decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) applications. Thus,  Dogecoin (DOGE) can only be used for payments, rather than being integrated  into more complex financial systems. Moreover, the recent Twitter poll that saw  Elon Musk looking for a successor to head up the social media platform has  raised doubts about his commitment to building a payments system on Twitter.  While it is true that Musk will still have a role running the  ""software"" and ""server teams,"" it remains to be seen  whether he will prioritize the integration of cryptocurrency payments into the  platform. Given these limitations, it is not surprising that 71% of industry  experts surveyed by Finder.com recommended that investors sell their Dogecoin  (DOGE). Dash (DASH) developer community experiences inactivity, leading to  market declineAnother cryptocurrency that has been facing challenges is Dash (DASH),  which has been experiencing a lack of activity within its developer community.  This has raised concerns among investors and users about the long-term  prospects of the coin. Dash (DASH) has struggled to keep up with the rapid pace  of innovation in the crypto world, with many other coins introducing new  features and technologies that Dash (DASH) has yet to adopt. The lack of activity  within the Dash (DASH) developer community has also had a negative impact on  the coin's market performance. Dash (DASH) has struggled to maintain its value  over the past few months, with its price falling significantly. As of now, the  price of Dash (DASH) is $43.95. This represents a significant decline from its  all-time high of $1,642.22, with Dash (DASH) being 97.32% below this peak. This  has caused many investors to question whether it is a good investment,  especially given the strong growth of other cryptocurrencies like Snowfall  Protocol (SNW).Snowfall Protocol's (SNW) successful presale and dApp prototype drive  investor confidenceSnowfall  Protocol (SNW) has been gaining a lot of attention in the cryptocurrency  market due to its focus on blockchain interoperability. This coin has already  gained significant investor support, even before its official launch. One of  the main factors contributing to Snowfall Protocol's (SNW) success is the  launch of a dApp prototype prior to its release. This has helped increase  investor confidence in the platform and its ability to provide a decentralized  and scalable blockchain solution. The presale of Snowfall Protocol (SNW) has  also been a major success, with the second stage ending a day early due to high  demand. The final stage of the presale will end on January 3, 2023, and experts are confident about Snowfall  Protocol's (SNW) future performance. Currently trading at $0.14, analysts believe that SNW has  the potential to increase by 5000%  after its official launch. This strong market performance has made Snowfall  Protocol (SNW) a highly sought-after coin among investors and has contributed  to its success in the market.ConclusionAs the cryptocurrency market evolves, it is critical to monitor the  performance of various coins. While Dogecoin (DOGE) and Dash (DASH) have seen  ups and downs, Snowfall  Protocol (SNW) is presently leading the charge. With its distinct  features and high investor demand, SNW is the one to watch in 2023.Get in while you can and invest in Snowfall Protocol (SNW)  today!!!

27c195b5ef79fe58fb54e40eb751b478,"I recently  went to a Christmas Party, there were 30 or so people attending, and as the  party wore on the noise level went up, my hearing ability went  down.   Yes, this happens to most people, and we just talk louder to  each other to make a conversation.  But if you are hard of hearing in the  first place, people don’t know you have a ‘disability’ because you can’t see  it. I admit I am becoming hard of hearing, though most wouldn’t know it, and I  began to feel isolated because I couldn’t even hear the person sitting next to  me and I started feeling invisible. Other hearing-impaired people will  understand this so well. In most  cases, hearing aids are worn to improve low-level hearing impairments that fall  well below the thresholds set by any regulations for hearing disabilities. The  logic here is that wearing a hearing aid helps to provide some assistance for  hearing loss or impairment, and this eliminates, to some degree, the state of  disability. Therefore, you cannot be classified as having a disability just  because you wear a hearing aid. Bit of a  Catch-22 situation isn’t it. If you  suffer from slight sight loss, you would wear glasses, right?  You go off  to the optician, spend some time having your sight tested, then find frames  that ‘suit you’, and people complement or admire your ‘aid’ to seeing.   Before you take the step to wearing glasses, jokes about ‘arms not being long  enough’ or ‘blind as a bat’ abound, and it’s all socially acceptable. But, be a  bit deaf, and see what happens.  You look blankly at the person talking to  you, try to work out what they might have said, and maybe because you have the  gist of the conversation, you are able to make some - probably noncommittal –  response.  Admit you can’t hear, and people roll their eyes behind your  back and try shouting - not always the answer, as anyone who is deaf will tell  you - or they say, in an exasperated voice ‘oh it doesn’t matter’, and you are  dismissed as being a half-wit or something. Wearing an  aid for hearing loss is somehow not as socially acceptable as wearing an aid  for sight loss. You don’t go to a showroom and pick something that ‘suits you’,  and people don’t complement or admire your ‘aid’ to hearing. They are ‘hidden  aids’, as if being deaf is shameful and should be concealed. According  to the World Health Organisation, disability definition can be broken down into  three categories: Impairment (this looks at the physical appearance of  the body), Activity Limitation (this deals with the limited physical  movements or hindrance due to the impairment), Restrictions in  participation (this involves the notion that society has reduced your  involvement in certain situations because of your impairment). Hearing  impairment falls into all three categories mentioned to some degree. Some  organizations define disability by breaking down the severity of the loss.  Thus, the exact disability classification that a person’s hearing impairment  will fall under depends on the impairment’s precise diagnosis. Therefore,  hearing impairment may fall under four categories – profound, severe, moderate, and mild. Have you  any idea how many people are affected by hearing loss? In Portugal, I  understand one in 10 suffer from some type of hearing loss - and it’s not just  confined to old age.  There are thousands who suffer from mild hearing  loss, and currently, there are 60,000 people in Portugal that are deaf sign  language users, and among that number are 100 working sign language  interpreters.   Hearing  loss is a serious condition that can sometimes be resolved with a very simple  solution that greatly improves the quality of life.  Devices are available  in both analogue and digital forms and come in a variety of types, shapes, and  sizes – behind the ear, in the ear, in the canal and completely-in-the-ear.  Hearing aids available on SNS tend to be large in the ear, but ones from the  private sector are almost invisible, and there are all-singing-all-dancing devices with controls from an app on your phone – but believe me, you need a  mortgage to afford them!",Pardon?

0ad237953c5aafdaec7310391ecf80d0,"In 2016, my wife and I chose to relocate from central London to  the Portuguese island of Madeira. We had visited Madeira on many occasions and  decided a more leisurely pace was reasonable at this stage of our life. I soon  realised retirement may not be required yet, and decided to start a small  property advisory business, Émigré Limited, helping UK and American expats to  relocate, both to the island and mainland Portugal and hopefully help them  overcome many of the difficulties I encountered. Since then, my primary role  has been to work with clients to find the property solution that best suits  their needs.  Now, as the days grow shorter and the seasons  change, I can see why so many Brits are looking to relocate to a warmer  climate. With the combination of spiking energy prices, strikes on the railway  system, higher interest payments on mortgages, costs and choices for education,  energy bills quadrupling and uncertainty of the government’s  next step; folk are searching for more certainty.  Searches in Google for relocating to Portugal have just become the  number one search engine request overtaking Spain and Greece, but why? It could very well be the 300 days of sunshine, the  blue flag award winning beaches, the low crime rate, relaxed atmosphere with  patient multilingual locals. Or the reduced cost of living, helping a family’s budget go further with food prices  around 67% cheaper than London, and talk of the country avoiding going into recession.  Relocating your family in a new and more welcoming tax environment  such as Portugal, which has a modern fiscal regime, a health system without  long waiting lists and with over 90% of the population speaking English, is a  beneficial scenario for many UK and American families. Instead of exporting  capital, it is time to export the family and future generations to countries  with attractive taxation schemes providing greater financial freedom. Do not  think of equity release, think of capital release in a lower inflationary  environment.  Whilst the Golden Visa approach might not be suitable for all  potential retirees, many who have elected to use the Golden Visa route consider  this to be an excellent stepping-stone to possible permanent residency. In  particular, the fund route is increasingly appealing as it allows investors to  diversify their investment portfolio, while benefiting from a second  citizenship and greater quality of life. HNW families are now seeing not only  the financial and succession planning opportunities in holding a second  residency, but also the opportunity to stretch retirement budgets or improve their lifestyles. It’s as much a Plan B as  a Plan A, particularly for Baby Boomers or highly mobile digital nomads.

1312828c5f9f88a7181685365b1258d6,"On this coast with extensive beaches and protected dunes,  where you can still build without seeing the house next door, residents and  investors from all over the world, who due to their financial capacity could  buy a house in any location, love the possibility of being able to walk freely  through the streets without anyone bothering them. At Comporta, you can  experience the much-desired ""slow-living"". (...) Melides, in turn,  was compared to 1950s Saint Tropez by the New York Times in 2021. Porta da Frente | Christie’s started by operating in the  real estate market of Cascais and Lisbon, later in Oeiras and, more recently,  in Comporta. How do you explain this evolution? It was in 1995 that Porta da Frente opened its doors and  presented itself for the first time to the market with an ambitious project  prepared to lead, based on the provision of a real estate service of  excellence. The idea of ​​the need for specialization in a single market led to  the choice of Cascais to implement and start our development in the medium/high  and high segment. This is a premium market with national and international  prestige, where we have positioned ourselves to this day as the main mediator  in the segment. Later, we expanded towards the Portuguese capital. Also in  Lisbon, where we are currently one of the two main players, we managed to make  a difference, as we led the change in customer service, through a personalized  and proximity service. The desire to work in a close and personalized way led us to  open our third office, in Oeiras, despite having previously worked in this  geographic area. In 2022, after going through 2 years of a pandemic with the  best results ever, we wanted to continue to grow and set out to open 2 new  offices: one in Parque das Nações and another in Comporta. As 26 years ago,  when we opened our first office in Cascais, our pioneering DNA will continue to  lead us in our constant search for new markets and regions. What makes Portugal, and more specifically, Comporta, so  attractive to foreign clients/investors? And what are the main countries of  origin of these customers and investors? Alentejo is a region of small traditional villages, vast  plains, and untouched nature. On this coast with extensive beaches and  protected dunes, where you can still build without seeing the house next door,  residents and investors from all over the world, who due to their financial  capacity could buy a house in any location, love the possibility of being able  to walk freely through the streets without anyone bothering them. At Comporta,  you can experience the much-desired ""slow-living"". Despite the fact that several projects are about to be  launched and many others are already being marketed, there is great concern  with the outdoor and private spaces of each property, which greatly delights  those who buy them. The Alentejo people, on the other hand, are warm and  friendly people like few others, with a very rich culture and a gastronomy of  ""eating and crying for more"". The climate is also another very  attractive factor for Portugal, and more particularly for the Alentejo region,  with heat from April to October.And this southern oasis has not gone unnoticed by the  international media: in 2019, Forbes did a report on ""Alentejo, the hidden  gem, as the new place to go in Portugal"". Melides, in turn, was compared  to 1950s Saint Tropez by the New York Times in 2021.At Porta da Frente | Christie's, we have a very strong  international focus, with more than 65% of deals closed with foreigners and  more than 35 buying nationalities. Currently, we have a very high demand from  French, English, American, and Spanish clients. What attracts clients and investors to Portugal,  especially high-net-worth individuals? Portugal has entered the radar of foreigners and will never  leave. The country offers a series of advantages and conditions far superior to  any European country, and with a lower cost of living.We offer the perfect balance between modernity and  tradition. In the greater Lisbon region, which follows the river and then the  sea, you can find all the amenities you would expect from a capital  city—museums, concert halls, restaurants, shops, and an international airport.  And, just a few kilometers away, you can live a completely different lifestyle  in Oeiras and Cascais, next to the beach and sea. Access to transport, ease of doing business with English or  French-speaking residents, and opportunities for education, work, and culture  are the main reasons why foreigners like the cities around Portugal, along with  the practice of sports, from surf to golf. And because health is the most precious asset of all,  another of the priorities of those who come to the country is also the health  system. Countries like the United States have an exclusively private health  service with very high prices, making medical care very expensive.Clients with high wealth normally seek privacy, quality of  construction and security. And Portugal offers all this at very competitive  prices. We are one of the safest countries in the world, with new construction  and high quality renovations, where you can walk freely throughout the country  at anytime. How do you see the residential market currently in  Portugal? Any market bubbles in sight? 2022 has been a very positive and dynamic year, with a sharp  growth of 65% (in sales and leases) compared to last year, where sales have a  special focus. This data shows us that, despite the war and a post-pandemic  period, real estate is the safest and most profitable investment. Demand has continued to be strong, both from Portuguese and  other nationalities, with an emphasis on the North American market, in addition  to those who have sought us out the most in recent years, such as Brazilians  and French. We have seen the integration of complete families, as well as  retirees, and more recently, customers with the profile of digital nomads.  We are confident and optimistic for the second half of 2022,  and we believe that the market will remain dynamic and in high demand. Proof of  this confidence in the market and in our capacity is the opening of two  physical stores next month.by Dadinha Forte Silva - Commercial Director at Porta da Frente | Christie's","Comporta and Melides, the hidden gems in Portugal",https://www.theportugalnews.com/news/2022-09-22/comporta-and-melides-the-hidden-gems-in-portugal/70527,portugalnews,www.theportugalnews.com,8,964

faa2db987e46b29ab10f54ffe78b0152,"Here are  some gardening hints that might help If you struggled with your garden last  year, but don’t get discouraged, as some are common challenges that all  gardeners miss at some point.  Sometimes we learn our lesson the first  time, but sometimes we need reminding!Spacing  plants appropriately  is something that many struggle with. When we start positioning new plants, it  seems like the spacing recommended is way too generous. ‘There’s no way they’ll  get that big’ we think as we plant them in closer than they should be. But they  will get that big. And having vegetables in particular too close together can  cause lower yields, require more watering, and make it easy for pests and  disease to spread faster. If your plants seemed too crowded last year, take a  ruler with you this year when you plant.Planting  too early when you  are itching to get your seeds into the ground. You’ve bought the seeds, and  they are burning a hole in your, well, wherever you keep them. You just want to  start them. Or you picked up some plants on the first lovely weekend of the  year. What can it hurt to begin planting early? As it turns out, quite a  lot.  Planting too early can result in spindly plants because of too  little light, they can be more prone to bolting, and you’ll also have to  transplant them up in pot sizes more times, which sometimes isn’t good for the  plant. Bougainvillea doesn’t take kindly to being moved too often is one to  look out for. If you put bedding plants out too early, they may not have the  right soil temperatures they need to establish well.  Weeding is the bane of every gardener’s life, and the trick is to get  them under control before they overwhelm your garden. There are three secrets  to weed management - start early, do a little at a time, and be consistent. If  you start early enough, they won’t have a chance to get established. The more  regularly you weed, the more you’ll keep them under control. Don’t attempt to  go out and weed the whole garden in a day. Pick one bed, one row, or one  type of plant, or one patch, and weed for 5-10 minutes a day. You’ll be  surprised how much weeding you can get done in 5 minutes.Watering, too much or too little, is a  balance that can be hard to achieve. It’s one of those gardening skills that  takes practice. For outdoor gardens, this can sometimes be difficult to control  because we are at the mercy of the weather.  Check your pots (or plots)  every two days during cool weather and every day during hot weather. Feel the  soil with your hand. If it’s dry 2-3cms down, you need to water it. On hot days  you may need to water potted plants every day. Early in the season, when your  plants are still babies, it’s a good idea to check the soil every day since  they’re much more susceptible to water stress. And even pots collect weeds, so  pull them out when you find them.Fertilising  is sometimes  something we forget. Many of the most common vegetables we grow are heavy  feeders, and they can deplete the soil of all its nutrients fast.  In the  short term, fertilize your plants consistently through the summer, especially  plants like tomatoes and peppers. In the long term, enrich your garden soil  with compost if you can, and consider a crop rotation routine, so you’re not  growing the same kind of plant in the same space and same soil every  year.  It’s also very easy to replace the soil completely with potted  plants, or even when you dig out an old plant, make the hole left behind a  little bigger, and line the hole with fresh soil. Plant  location matters. Particularly if your garden is new to you, make a ‘sun map’ of your garden, which will  give you an idea of where you have full sun, complete or partial shade.   Check your plants’ labels for location guidance or check with the staff at the  centre when buying.",Common gardening problems,https://www.theportugalnews.com/news/2022-12-27/common-gardening-problems/73293,portugalnews,www.theportugalnews.com,3,677

3ab39cc3e959584f2da6ffe39bece056,"Of course,  it's not a uniquely Iberian thing, there clearly seems to be an ongoing  obsession with the fine art of campanology all over the European continent, not  least of all in France. However, the Iberian variety do seem to be unusually  bold - as in LOUD!  These great  clappering rogues have often brought me (the typically unwary visitor) many a  rude awakening at secluded Portuguese Praças. Just as, perhaps, I might have  embarrassed myself by rudely dozing off mid-coffee-break on a sultry summer's  afternoon, ""BONG!-BONG!!"" go those bells. Yes, no fewer than two  obligatory (extra loud) ""BONGS!"" that might put Big Ben to shame when  experienced at such close proximity. For some reason, church clocks in Portugal  often chime twice at the top of each hour, as if there was even the remotest  possibility that anyone who isn't absolutely stony deaf could have missed the  first almighty CLANG! Even English  cities with their vast, grey (Coronation Street) chimney-scapes are endlessly  filled with often repetitive bell chimes which grate through mist and murk  bearing the unmistakable wafts of coal smoke and kerosene; tainting the chill  Autumnal twilight.  In Ireland, at  6pm sharp, Irish TV dedicates a whole minute of its daily programme schedule to  the monotones of an ""Angelus"" bell which routinely rings out before  Radio Telefis Éireann's main evening news bulletin. This is an Irish  broadcasting tradition that predates television in Éire, hailing all the way  back to Radio Éireann days which broadcast from studios located at the historic  An Post (GPO) building in O'Connell Street during the 1950's. Unnerving  Frankly, I've  always been slightly unnerved by the sound of even the most distant church  bells. Having been brought up in a tiny Welsh community where, if my childhood  recollections serve me correctly, chiming church bells always seemed to hold  somewhat funereal undertones. In later life, whilst visiting large English  towns and cities, weekend mornings often commenced far earlier than originally  anticipated because the dreaded chain-ringers commenced their high-decibel  rehearsal routines bright and early. Seemingly endless renditions that  prematurely led me (bleary eyed) to the nearest coffee shop. I remember feeling  distinctly unnerved by those ecclisiastical renditions because they evoked such  somber childhood flashbacks; of days spent whispering behind respectfully drawn  curtains. Credits: envato elements; Author: By ADDICTIVE_STOCK;  I guess the  abundance of ancient (yet still highly efficient bells) are to be expected in  any great European city where there are bound to be an abundance of churches  and cathedrals all merrily tinkling, bonging and jangling especially on the  Sabbath and during religious festivals. Festivals that often hold particular  reverence in certain regions. For instance, the run up to Easter is  particularly well marked in Sevilla where the incessant chimes of carillons  resonate across this beautiful city, seemingly at all hours. Just as you might  find yourself settling down after a prolonged recital, glass in hand with some  reading material firmly grasped in the other, another jubilant high decibel  rendition shatters that transient moment of relative tranquility. The likes of  me, so verily spoilt by the blessings of a quiet rural upbringing, begin to  pine for long lost days when our village church bells only soberly chimed the  passing of the dear-departed or proudly proclaimed the occasion of a joyful  summer wedding. Yin & Yan, in perfect harmony. Uncannily loud Whilst there  are church clocks in Portugal that routinely strike the hour twice, there are  some that do so half-hourly or even every fifteen minutes. How many of us have,  in perfectly good faith, booked our Airbnb hostelries in some remote Alentejo  town only to discover the floodlit church clock (just across a picturesque  alleyway) obligingly reminds everyone of the time every 15 minutes without  fail. What will not have been noted in all the Airbnb bumph is that this  happens all night long.  By now, you  might well be forgiven for thinking that this article may be looking  increasingly like the sorry diatribe of a helpless insomniac. However, I will  defend my abject moaning by again declaring that those bells do tend to be  uncannily loud! I didn't miss the opportunity to tentatively point out this  minor omission to our charming Airbnb host, politely declaring that the  relentless tolling was certainly never mentioned in any of their bumph.  However, I was gazed at curiously by all and sundry because I'm sure that  fatigue, by this juncture, was quite likely to be making me come over all Quasimodo  as I gormlessly protested about ""THE BELLS!... THE BELLS!!"" - that  most apocryphal snippet from the Hunchback of Notre-Dame. At the very  least, I can console myself with this thought. I've taken to obsessing about a  matter that might one day generate a vaguely constructive outcome for all the  world's light sleepers and those of us who might require a little bit of hush  in order to think? My deep-seated fascination with ""ACME NOISE  GENERATORS"" stemmed from what's been little more than a pet gripe? Perhaps  if I protest with suitably weighted gusto, I can create for myself a  semi-ambassadorial role for the long-lost luxury of undisturbed (bell-free)  slumber? I may even aspire to liberate entire conurbations from a key element  of maddening noise pollution? There are, surely, numerous less honorable  aspirations doing the rounds? Hardly Bond Villain territory really.Credits: envato elements; Author: by RossHelen;  Outrageous grumpiness? Realistically,  perhaps it's just a state of outrageous grumpiness that has finally riled my  once contented soul? It must be. Because these days, should I happen to be  dining solo, I often catch myself peering irritably over my spectacles like  some excessively bumptious headmaster; cynically scanning and cunningly  observing the folks sitting at the next table. Will they or will they not stoop  to annoyingly photographing their platters of food? By this juncture, my own  dinner (however excellent) has sunk into the realms of a secondary  (unphotographed) consideration. The wait to find out whether the culinary  delights destined for the next table pass as being Instagrammable will be  brutal. I will have already bet with myself that if I call it correctly and  they DO go into snap-happy mode, I won't have to leave double the usual tip.  Serious stuff indeed!

So out come the cutlery,  pure white napkins are carefully unfolded and it's now just a case of will it  be eyes-down for a full tummy or will the ever roving lens of ubiquitous mobile  phone-cams momentarily trump all?

b639f7cc50c81981632096de3e25ad0b,"Previous studies have focused on the negative impact of  video games in young people, such as depression or aggressiveness. However, the  present study analysed data on a larger scale on the cognitive development of  the adolescent brain in 2,217 children, the Adolescent Brain Cognitive  Development study (ABCD study), funded by the American Institutes of Health  (NIH). Researchers reviewed participant responses, cognitive  test results, and brain imaging of approximately 2,000 children between the ages  of 9 and 10, divided into two groups: those who never play video games and  those who play them every day for three or more hours.This was the duration chosen because it exceeds the  American Academy of Paediatrics recommendation of one or two hours of video  games per day for older children.Both groups had to perform the same two tasks. In the  first, arrows pointing left or right were shown to the children, who had to  click on the corresponding button as quickly as possible.For the second task, the youngsters were shown a first  face and then a second, after which they had to say if they belonged to the  same person, this time to test their working memory, a short-term memory.After correcting some related statistical biases, such  as parental income, I.Q., and mental  health, researchers found that children who played video games consistently obtained  better results on the tasks.During the tests, children's brains were observed  using specific imaging techniques. The brains of the children that played video  games showed more activity in areas associated with attention and working  memory. ""The findings raise the interesting possibility that video games  provide a cognitive learning experience with measurable neurocognitive  effects,"" conclude the study.However, it is still not possible to know whether  better cognitive performance leads to playing for longer hours, or if it is the  fact that playing for longer periods improves the performance in the children observed.For these and other answers, the study is expected to  continue, to allow more structured information and conclusions to be collected  when these children are older. The continuity of the work will also correlate  with other variables that may interfere with these preliminary results, such as  the children's home environment, physical activity, and sleep quality. Excessive  screen time is obviously bad for mental health and physical activity, mention researchers, but study results show that the  time spent playing video games may be better than the same period of time watching  videos on YouTube for example, which has no detectable cognitive effects.For more information contact Grupo HPA Saude on +351 282 420 400 ",Video games and cognitive performance in pre-adolescents,https://www.theportugalnews.com/news/2022-12-30/video-games-and-cognitive-performance-in-pre-adolescents/73365,portugalnews,www.theportugalnews.com,6,385

""Naturally taxes, fees and other  values defined by the State"" are excluded, added Iberdrola, in a  statement.Galp will reduce electricity bills by around 11%, on  average, from the beginning of 2023, an official source told Lusa. Thus, said  the same source, ""for an average consumption of a typical family with two  children, the most common in Galp's customer portfolio, this update will  translate into an average decrease of 3.5 euros to six euros"" per month.GasThe natural gas bill will increase, starting in January, by  around 3% for the most representative customers in the regulated market, after  a deviation in forecast purchase prices, announced ERSE.In a statement, the entity said that it had updated  ""the price of the energy tariff in the regulated market, by an additional  two euros per MWh, with effect from January 1, 2023"".Thus, the average monthly bill, as of January 2023, for a  couple without children (1st consumption tier, consumption 1,610 kWh/year)  increases by 0.33 euros and for a couple with two children (2nd tier of  consumption, consumption 3,407 kWh/year) rises by 0.70 euros.For its part, Galp indicated that for its customers  ""natural gas bills will remain unchanged in the first three months of  2022"".RentsRents can only rise, from January, up to 2%, after the  Government published a law to that effect, in Diário da República, in October.TollsTolls will increase by 4.9% from January, according to the  Minister of Infrastructure.""It was clear to us that an increase of 9.5% and 10.5%  was unbearable, but there are also contracts and responsibilities and we tried  to find a balanced solution that would allow for a smaller increase"", said  Minister Pedro Nuno Santos.Thus, from January 1, 2023, toll rates will increase by 4.9%  in the amount borne by users.

9d2cd8c1589246fd26ab10b12257caf4,"There is a persistent misconception that  Portuguese do not buy real estate in Portugal, and that foreigners are driving  the real estate market. However, when we take a closer look, the numbers indicate  differently. In fact, according to the Institute for National Statistics (INE),  approximately 93.6% of recorded residential purchases are by  nationals and only 6.4% accounts for foreigners’ purchase. As well, the  following statistics from INE provide a clear picture that the Portuguese  residential market is booming at a very fast pace and a sudden drop is hard to  imagine. In the referenced quarter, non-resident investors were responsible for  6.4% of the total number of transactions (2,783 dwellings) which represents an increase of 2.0% over the  previous quarter,  and corresponds to 11.9% of the total value  transacted. In this data, the European Union category corresponded to 3.6% and  the remaining countries to 2.8%.In the second quarter of 2022, the Housing Price Index (IPHab) increased  by 13.2% year-on-year, and 0.3 percentage points (p.p.) above the previous  quarter. Notably, the increase in property prices was more expressive in  existing housing with  14.7% compared to 8.4% in new housing.Compared to the first three months of the year, the IPHab increased by  3.1% (3.8% in the 1st quarter of 2022).

By category, existing  housing transactions reached 35,742 units, corresponding to a year-on-year  increase of 1.8%. In new housing, the rate of change was higher, 18.9%,  totaling 7,865 transactions. In total, in the period under analysis, 38,181 homes were acquired by families, representing 87.6% of the market transactions or 7.2 billion euros.The value of the properties transacted stood at 8.3 billion euros, which accounts for 19.5% more than the value in the same quarter of 2021. From this total transaction value, 6.3 billion euros corresponded  to transactions of existing housing – 16.8% increase compared to the same period in 2021 – and 2 billion euros were related to new  housing transactions (29.0% year-on-year increase). Thus, the value of these transactions increased by 2.5% in the second  quarter of 2022 compared to the previous quarter.

The U.S.  military initially claimed to have recovered the wreckage of a Flying Saucer.  However, the story quickly changed that the wreck was a weather balloon, and  the incident has been the subject of much speculation and conspiracy theories  since.2.    Gordon Cooper: accounts 1951. An astronaut and test pilot, Gordon claimed to have witnessed a  flying saucer while on a mission in 1951. He described seeing multiple craft as  silver and circular, flying higher than he could in a jet fighter. Cooper also  reported seeing a negative film of a flying saucer landing on three telescoping  legs. When his film crew approached, the vehicle flew off. He sent the film to  D.C. and didn't hear anything since.3.     The ICBM  Claim: In 1964, Robert Jacobs, a U.S. Air Force officer, claimed to have  witnessed a UFO disabling an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) during a  test launch. After the story broke, Jacobs' was hassled repeatedly at his home,  and an explosion destroyed his mailbox.Credits: Supplied Image; Author: Chris Lehto; 4.    The Westall  UFO incident: In 1966 Westall, Victoria, Australia, According to witness  accounts, a large, unidentified flying object descended into a nearby grassy field,  where it stayed for 20 minutes. Students and a teacher at a nearby school  reported seeing the craft depart with five smaller aircraft.5.   The Nuclear  Event at Malmstrom: In 1967, Robert Salas, a U.S. Air Force officer, claimed  that a ""hovering orange fireball"" at the gate knocked all ten nuclear  missiles offline! Salas has been holding a press conference in Washington every  five years since. Rep Gallagher put Salas's account into the U.S. congressional  record summer of 2022.6.   The  Rendlesham Forest Incident: 1980. The Rendlesham UFO event, also known as the  ""British Roswell,"" refers to a series of reported UFO sightings near  a U.S./ British military base in Suffolk, England. One of the key witnesses to  the events was John Burroughs, a U.S. Air Force security officer. According to  his testimony, he and several other airmen observed strange lights in the sky  and even encountered a glowing, metallic ship on the ground.7.    The Belgian  Wave: In 1989 and 1990, was a series of mass UFO sightings. ""Three unusual  lights"" prompted the launch of 2 F-16 fighters. One hundred forty-three  witnesses spoke up afterward. Dozens of police reportedly saw the objects.  Flight radars recorded the things, but there was some controversy because a  primary photo later proved fake.8.    Ariel School: On September 16, 1994, a group of students and teachers at Ariel School in  Ruwa, Zimbabwe, reported seeing a UFO hovering over the school grounds. According  to one student, the UFO was ""shaped like a flattened disc and was silver  in color. It was about the size of two classrooms and had a series of red and  green lights around the edges."" The students made similar compelling  accounts and haven't changed their story in decades!9.    The  ""Varginha UFO incident"": refers to a supposed crash of a Tic-Tac-like  vehicle near Varginha, Brazil, in 1996. According to eyewitness accounts, two  humanoid creatures were spotted and captured by authorities. One military troop  died from supposedly touching a being. US C-130 aircraft allegedly transported  the wreckage and beings.10. The Phoenix Lights: on March 13, 1997, a series of  UFO sightings occurred across Nevada and Arizona. Over 750 people across  multiple states saw strange lights in large triangular formations flying  silently overhead. A self-proclaimed Air Force maintenance troop called the  local news that night and said two F-15s launched from nearby Luke Air Force  Base to intercept the lights. The pilots returned shaken and  ""scared."" Witnesses said the flying lights made up a 300-m-long  boomerang.11. Turkey UFO: In the summers of 2007, 2008, and 2009, a  security guard Yalcin Yilmaz, filmed strange lights and what appeared to be  metallic flying saucers. Roger Lear, a noted Ufologist, reportedly saw the  saucers with his own eyes after a UFO conference in Istanbul, Turkey. He said  you could ""see beings"" in the windows. Yilmaz used a super long-range  zoom lens and filmed very detailed footage of a UFO. Some experts claim it was  a misidentified cruise ship or just a hoax.I plan to go to Turkey and investigate for myself summer  of 2023.12. The Nimitz Incident: November 2004 The Modern Smoking  Gun. The Nimitz engagement made me and many other people take notice of the Phenomenon.  During training exercises off the coast of San Diego, the new Princeton Radar  picked up strange radar contacts coming down from space. They reset the radar,  and the contacts were still there. After a week of this, radar operator Kevin  Day vectored new squadron commander, F-18 Pilot David Fravor, to identify the  contacts. The pilots reported engaging with a ""flying Tic-Tac"" for 5  minutes. The ""white, smooth object"" moved without inertia and seemed  to interact with the water surface or a larger object just under the water. The  Tic-Tac reportedly left ""as if shot like a bullet.""13. The Gimbal Case: In 2013, a box-orb UFO was  reportedly seen ""almost daily"" by Navy F-18 pilots after a new radar  upgrade. The sightings, one captured on video as ""The Gimbal"" video,  have been the subject of much debate and speculation, with some experts  claiming that it was caused by ""glare."" I show it is still anomalous  on my YouTube channel through two different methods.14. Catalina Islands ""Drone Swarm"": Finally, in  2019, there were multiple UFO drone sightings off the coast of San Diego,  including an encounter with the USS Omaha. A Navy visual team recorded the  drones in optical and night vision. Some footage shows the objects going  underwater, although skeptics argue it is an apparent optical illusion. Task  force lead Scott Bray said they were ""probably drones,"" but insiders  say the military still considers them unidentified objects.

8301128b7acf175c32de572aeab6e503,"The Portuguese Riviera, which stretches from the West of Lisbon all the  way to Sintra, is one of the most expensive coastline regions in the country.  Amongst the cities making up the beautiful area, Cascais is one that especially  stands out with its chic and tropical landscapes and its luxurious quality of  life. From colorful Portuguese style mansions to new and modern beachside  condos, Cascais has something to offer for everyone. With its international schools, efficient public transportation system,  as well as parks and beaches, the area is continuously attracting international  investors and expats. One of the most attractive features of living in Cascais  is the fact that one can enjoy the luxurious Riviera lifestyle – palm trees in  their backwards and sun-soaked beaches all around – while benefiting from  a cost of living which is still below the international market average. As well, Cascais  remains 45 minutes away from the capital city by train, hence many working  professionals and families choose to have the best of both worlds by residing  in the area and working in Lisbon.  Despite the current economic climate, the real estate market in Portugal  remains stable and liquid. In Cascais, property prices remain high, particularly in the luxury segment, as demand continues to exceed supply and the region continues to  attract international investors, expats and Portuguese natives alike. According  to JLL Q2 market pulse report, the cost of real estate for the area of  Cascais/ Estoril has remained stable with an average sale price  of €8,000 to €10,500 per square meter –the upper bound representing the average  sales price for new builds or high-end properties. Moreover, in the second  quarter of the year, the median house rental value in the district of Cascais  increased by +19.6% compared to the previous year.  The demand for properties in Cascais is not expected to decrease as  buyers from this market segment tend to be high-income families that turn to  prime real estate investment during high inflationary periods. Also, since  these investors tend to be marginally less affected by increasing mortgage  rates, the interest of diverse investors in Cascais’s property market is  expected to persist.

There is another responsibility, which is an operational, business responsibility,  namely because there is public money” involved in this case of compensation  from TAP, said Tiago Faria Lopes, referring to the “two players” who are still  at TAP, the CEO , Christine Ourmières-Widener, and the chairman, Manuel Beja.“As a matter of solidarity, and loyalty to the minister  [Pedro Nunes], if the minister resigns, naturally, we all hope that they [CEO  and chairman] resign,” he said, listing the reasons why he defends these two  layoffs at the airline.First, “due to all these scandals” related to TAP; second,  due to the lie they wrote” to the Securities Market Commission (CMVM). “If they  lie to the CMVM, which is the regulatory body, they are guaranteed to lie to  taxpayers and TAP Air Portugal workers”, he defended.As for a possible departure of the CEO of TAP, the president  of the SPAC says that “there is evidence” that there is an addendum to the  contract of Christine Ourmières-Widener that determines that at the end of the  contract, or due to early termination, she will have a bonus. “Guaranteed that  this bonus, based on the half million euros that Alexandra Reis received, will  be much greater. The scandal will be greater. Now it remains to be seen whether  it is true or not,” he said.The resignation of Pedro Nuno Santos was the third in the  Government in two days, after Alexandra Reis, from the Treasury, at the centre  of the controversy over TAP's compensation, and the Secretary of State for  Infrastructure, Hugo Santos Mendes, who accompanied the decision by Pedro Nuno  Santos.The Minister of Finance, Fernando Medina, dismissed the  Secretary of State for the Treasury on Tuesday, less than a month after  Alexandra Reis took office and after four days of controversy over the  compensation of 500 thousand euros from TAP, supervised by Pedro Nuno Santos. Alexandra Reis received compensation for leaving early, in  February, as executive administrator of the air carrier. In June, she was  nominated by the Government for the presidency of Navegação Aérea de Portugal  (NAV) and this month she was chosen for Secretary of State for the Treasury.Related articles:€980 million more for TAPCalls for the government to explain TAP situationMinister for Infrastructure resigns in TAP scandal",Pilots call for TAP CEO resignation,https://www.theportugalnews.com/news/2022-12-29/pilots-call-for-tap-ceo-resignation/73405,portugalnews,www.theportugalnews.com,5,416

1f0cdb65685b61bd964f7c9d89d882c1,"Around 10 percent of the value of new loans for the purchase  of a house were allocated to foreign citizens, according to estimates by the  Bank of Portugal (BdP). This growth is explained as being due to the high  demand from foreigners for housing in Portugal and by the fact that these  buyers are now increasingly of working age.According to a report by DN ""Credit to foreign citizens  (residents and non-residents) has increased in the recent period, but continues  to have a small weight"", says latest Financial Stability Report, which  also reveals that ""of the value of new credit operations in 2021 and in  the first half of 2022, 10% was granted to foreign citizens"". DN/Dinheiro Vivo questioned the supervisor about the nominal value of the loans in  question, but an official source clarified that ""the requested information  includes an estimated component, which is why the reference in the Financial  Stability Report is a percentage and rounded to the nearest decimal  point"". But if we look at the weight of foreigners in the stock of  housing loans granted by banks - that is, not only in new loans but in the  total amount on the banks' balance sheets - there is an increase. There was an  increase from 6.4 percent to 7 percent between the end of 2019 and June 2022.The Bank of Portugal also notes that home loans granted by  national financial institutions to foreign citizens tend to have lower risk  indicators. The loan to value ratio (LTV) is lower and contract maturities are  also shorter.More foreign buyersThis increase in home loans granted to foreign citizens  coincides with a strong appetite for national real estate. ""Housing  transactions by non-residents have increased significantly in the recent  period, in particular involving buyers residing outside the European  Union"", indicated the Bank of Portugal.The Bank of Portugal concludes that this external demand has  contributed to the increase in property prices ""The regional heterogeneity  of demand from non-residents, contributes to a differentiated evolution of  prices between regions. In particular, in the recent period, marked by the  increase of demand from non-residents, the growth of house prices has been more  accentuated in regions where their weight is higher and the percentage of  transactions financed by credit is lower"", reads the same document.In the second quarter of 2022, the median house price grew,  year-on-year, by 19.8 percent in the Algarve, 14.5 percent in the Metropolitan  Area of Lisbon, 11 percent in Porto and 10.8 percent in the rest of the  country. ""In aggregate terms, the percentage of transactions financed  using domestic credit has increased in recent years, but remains 25 percentage  points below that observed in 2009"", details the Bank of Portugal. Reflecting a greater intensity of demand from non-residents  in certain areas of the country, the weight of credit in housing transactions  differs significantly by region. In the Algarve, the percentage of transactions  financed by home loans, in 2021, was around 20 percent. In other words, the  majority of property purchases were paid for in cash or using credit from  foreign banks. In the Metropolitan Areas of Lisbon and Porto, it represented  around 60 percent and 70 percent of the value of transactions, respectively,  reaching more than 80 percent in the remaining regions.",10% of home loans given to foreign buyers,https://www.theportugalnews.com/news/2022-12-21/10-of-home-loans-given-to-foreign-buyers/73093,portugalnews,www.theportugalnews.com,7,493

6355af4bce6d25e294c919a3fa39fb67,"According  to Christian tradition, the Magi Kings gave gifts to the baby Jesus, and, in  Portugal, this date is also celebrated.Kings'  DayKings Day  is celebrated on 6 January and the tradition, which dates back to the 8th  century, is celebrated, where Catholics venerate the Magi Kings Melchior,  Gaspar, and Baltazar. According to biblical texts and stories passed down from  generation to generation, the three Kings offered Jesus gold, frankincense, and  myrrh. Each of the gifts has a meaning, and some of these gifts have remained  present in the Catholic tradition, such as the gold in the church's buildings  and artefacts and incense, used in various celebrations.Normally,  on the 6 January, people will sing the “janeiras”, which are popular  Christmas-themed songs, usually linked to the Christian tradition. “Janeiras”  are sung from door-to-door and as a form of thanks, the inhabitants of the  house let the singers in and offer wine, and sweets, among other delicacies.It is on  Epiphany, known in Portugal as Dia de Reis, that the Portuguese cease their  Christmas celebrations. It is on that day that the Christmas lights in the  streets are turned off, as well as the Christmas trees are dismantled, as  people look forward to entering the New Year with all the luck in the world.Bolo ReiBolo Rei is  probably the Christmas delicacy most consumed by the Portuguese during the  Christmas season.Despite  being a very Portuguese delicacy, its history goes back to the Roman  festivities. The Catholic Church later took advantage of the tradition and  converted it to Christianity, linking it with Christmas.Credits: PA; Author: PA; In  Portugal, Bolo Rei became popular in the 19th century, based on a French recipe  for a crown-shaped cake. However, with the end of the monarchy, the  nomenclature of the cake was at risk, as the republicans wanted to eliminate  everything that could be related to the monarchy. For a while, pastry shops  adopted other names for the cake, such as Bolo Nacional, Bolo de Natal, or even  Ex-Bolo-Rei. Even so, republican governors were unhappy with the changes and  created names such as Bolo Presidente and Bolo Arriaga, in honour of the first  president of the Portuguese republic.Credits: PA; Author: PA;Nomenclatures  aside, Bolo Rei kept its original name, however, at the end of the 20th century  some changes were made. For a long time, Bolo Rei brought a small toast and a  broad bean. The toast would bring joy to whoever received it, and the broad  bean would dictate who would have to buy the Bolo Rei the following year.  However, in 1999, Portuguese law dictated that it would not be allowed to place  gifts in Bolo Rei, as it could constitute a health hazard, due to the  possibility of asphyxiation, or gastric diseases.The Bolo  Rei is nothing more than a cake, made with light dough, and decorated with  candied fruit and powdered sugar. The cake even has a long shelf life and if it  starts to get dry, the Portuguese usually cut some slices and toast them in the  oven, to eat with butter, at any time of the day. There is  also a variant of Bolo Rainha, with the same recipe, but decorated with dried  fruits.Credits: PA; Author: PA; ",Kings’ Day in Portugal,https://www.theportugalnews.com/news/2022-12-28/kings-day-in-portugal/73294,portugalnews,www.theportugalnews.com,4,486

50b1ab2c66ed9174683ffcfa0b5051dd,"According to the SPACE study, carried out by the European Central Bank (ECB), which investigates financial behaviour in the eurozone  every two years, among residents of the Monetary Union, the use of physical  money has reduced. It is a trend in most eurozone countries, but especially  prevalent in southern European countries: Portugal, Greece, Spain, and Cyprus.But Europeans still like physical money. For 60% of European  citizens, being able to have physical money is still important. In addition,  people believe that using cash makes them more aware of their spending habits. Faced  with possible energy crises and power outages, the discussion of banknotes and  coins versus digital payments becomes relevant.In the 19 countries of the eurozone, payments are generally  made with banknotes and coins. But even so, the percentage of cash payments in  all transactions dropped to 59% in 2022. Three years earlier, the share was  72%, and six years earlier 79%.Measured in terms of turnover, card payments are, for the  first time, surpassing cash payments. According to ECB data, 46% of sales in  stores were paid by card and 43% in cash. Differences in the proportion of coin  and banknote payments are due to the fact that small amounts are more often  paid in cash, while large amounts are more likely to be paid by debit or credit  card.The survey results illustrate a continuing trend towards  fewer physical payments at points of sale. But consumers are also shopping  online more and more often. The percentage of e-commerce payments in all  payments rose to 17% in 2022, compared to 6% three years earlier. In terms of  turnover, the share grew from 14% to 28%. Most Europeans do not want to do without banknotes and  coins.

These are three phenomenal cookbooks from 2022  you should definitely have on your radar…1. Big Has HOME: Recipes From North London To North  Cyprus by Hasan SemayThere was always going to be a lot of anticipation  around North London-based chef Hasan Semay’s debut cookbook. Known as Big Has,  he’s one of Jamie Oliver protégées, who trained in the Fifteen programme. Like  his mentor, Has is all about bringing delicious food to the masses. His Turkish  Cypriot heritage is strongly felt in dishes like grilled octopus and lamb and  potato kofte, and he also draws upon Mediterranean influences in crowd-pleasing  recipes like cacio e pepe and fried courgette flowers. Credits: PA; Author: PA; Badadez  kebabIngredients:(Serves 4)1 chicken,  weighing 1.8kgA bunch of  thyme800g round  shallots, peeled1.5kg Cyprus  potatoes, peeled and quartered lengthways500g sweet  pointed peppers320g long  green Turkish peppersA good glug  of vegetable oil3–4tbsp  tomato pureeOlive oilSea salt  and black pepperTo serve:Good-quality  olive oilChopped  flat-leaf parsleyZest of 1  lemonRiceTurkish  yogurtNice breadMethod:1. Preheat  the oven to 160°C fan/180°C/350°F/gas mark 4.2. Start by  breaking down your chicken. Cut off the legs, then split the thighs and the  legs. Take off the wings with a little breast. Cut out the backbone and cut the  breasts into three equal pieces on the bone. Keep the breast on the bone –  that’s our little safety blanket to stop our chicken drying out, plus the bone  adds to the flavour.3. Stick  your chicken in a bowl, give it a good glug of olive oil, season with salt and  pepper and a bunch of thyme. Don’t really worry about marinating, just dress  it.4. Heat a  heavy-based frying pan over a medium heat with a good glug of olive oil and  seal your chicken. Make sure you brown your chicken on all sides to build  flavour but don’t burn the thyme. Once the chicken is sealed, stick it on a  plate and set aside.5. Now,  it’s pretty much just stick everything in a roasting tray. Add the shallots and  potatoes first, then slice the pointed sweet peppers into three, remove the  seeds and add to the mix. The green Turkish peppers can just go in whole. Add  the vegetable oil and season everything heavily with salt and pepper.6. Stir the  tomato puree into 850ml boiling water, then add to the mix. Add the chicken we  sealed off earlier, leaving the breast behind for later. Place the tray in the  oven and cook for two hours. We want the potatoes to suck up all the flavour.7. After  two hours, add the breast meat over the top. Don’t mix it through as you want  to avoid breaking up the potatoes. Turn the oven up to 210°C  fan/230°C/450°F/gas mark 8 and cook for 15 minutes. The chicken breast will  cook through, and your potatoes will crisp around the edges.8. Pull it  out of the oven and let everything rest for 10 minutes because otherwise it  will 100% burn your entire mouth. I like to finish mine with a good glug of  olive oil, chopped parsley and lemon zest. Serve with rice, yogurt and bread.

Heat two  centimetres of oil in a shallow frying pan to 190˚C. Use a slotted spoon to  lower the plantain chunks into the hot oil. Cook in batches for a few minutes,  turning frequently to ensure browning on all sides. Remove and drain on kitchen  paper. Sprinkle with a pinch of fine sea salt and the paprika while the  plantain is still hot, and toss to coat well.2. To  prepare the shakshuka, pour the olive oil into a 26-centimetre saute pan, for  which you have a lid, and set over a medium heat. Add the onion and peppers,  season with the salt and cook for five minutes until softened.3. Add the  garlic, red harissa and tomato puree and cook for three minutes, stirring  frequently, then stir in the dry spices, and the chilli flakes if your harissa  isn’t hot enough. Tip in the tomatoes, cover and simmer for 15–20 minutes,  until thickened and sweetened, stirring occasionally and breaking down the  tomatoes with a wooden spoon.4. Scoop  half of the sauce into a bowl then spread the remaining sauce out evenly in the  pan. Scatter half of the plantain chunks over the top, then pour the two beaten  eggs over the top to cover the plantain and sauce. Cover and cook for two  minutes.5. Pour the  reserved sauce over the layer of eggs and gently spread out evenly. Scatter  over the remaining plantain. Crack the remaining eggs, one at a time, into a  bowl. Use the back of the spoon to make six ‘wells’ in the sauce. Pour an egg  in each one, cover the pan and cook for a final 10 minutes over a medium-low  heat, or until the eggs are cooked as you like them. If you have an ovenproof  pan, you can also finish the shakshuka in an oven preheated to 200˚C/180˚C fan/  gas mark 6 for five minutes.6.

17cc9d84d4722ddf44976a754e32bec9,"Going vegan in January may be something you’re  eager to get involved with, to improve your diet, protect the planet or try  something new. But plant-based living can come with a hefty price tag.“Veganism has been around since 1944 and with  support from groups like The Vegan Society, there have always been ways to  choose more vegan meals without breaking the bank,” says Patrick Huang,  co-founder of MeatFreed.“There are many vegans who offer support and  guidance, as well as cost-saving and time-efficient hacks to make sure choosing  more vegan meals doesn’t mean inconvenience or being left worse off,” Huang  says.“We found in one of our recent surveys that cost,  and inconvenience were two of the main barriers cited by those wanting to try  and eat more vegan and plant-based meals. We also found nearly half of our  community are worried about the cost of living and how that can impact food  prices, with 60% saying they would be forced to change their diet based on what  they can afford,” he explains.But, it is possible to cut down on meat and dairy,  while also saving money. Here’s how…1. Look for deals and vegan offers“Veganism, vegetarianism, and plant-based meals are  becoming a whole lot more mainstream at both restaurants and supermarkets,”  says Huang.2. Meal plan“Just like if you’re eating meat or any other diet,  meal planning can be helpful to cut down on waste, use up all of your food  shopping, and stop you giving into takeaway temptations if you’re trying to save  money,” says Huang. “Even just a rough guide of meals you will cook that week  and the ingredients you need means you can be more focused when you go food shopping,  and avoid getting distracted by things on offer or discounts you don’t need.”3. Take it slowYou don’t have to change everything at once, and  doing so may mean buying loads of new things that you may not even enjoy.“Becoming plant-based doesn’t have to be all or  nothing,” he says. “Many people do switch and go completely cold turkey on  other diets, but that doesn’t have to be the only way. Even starting with a  meat-free Monday or trying to include one vegan or plant-based meal into your  weekly menu is great.“Then you can build from there and increase if you  want to, or look at a flexitarian diet that allows you to switch between vegan  and vegetarian or even eating meat.”So take your time, see what you like, and don’t  break the bank on new stuff straight away.4. Store things correctlyTikTok is awash with fun and helpful money-saving  hacks and there are loads of ways you can get the most out of vegan produce  just by storing it correctly.Creator Armen Adamjan suggests ventilating bags  correctly with holes, growing spring onions in water from the roots, and  wrapping lettuce in foil.Credits: PA; Author: PA; 5. Don’t buy pre-prepared“I love to buy nuts and seeds in bulk and roast  them myself – much healthier without the salt – and pop them on salads and  stir-fries or as a snack,” says the author of Asian Green, Ching-He Huang.“Plus they last longer. Just eight minutes at 180  degrees C until golden and then cool on a tray and transfer to a storage jar.”6. Shop in bulk“A great way to save money on a vegan diet is to  bulk-buy whole foods such as lentils, beans, and pulses. These are all cheap to  buy and incredibly healthy. Add to stews, salads, curries, and pasta dishes for  extra flavour and protein,” says Rachel Stone, from vegan campaigning charity  Viva!.7. Eat with the seasons“Another way to save money while going vegan is to  buy seasonal produce,” adds Stone. “Visit your local fruit and veg market for  great deals.” This January, look for beetroot, celeriac, chicory,  kale, leeks, mushrooms, squash, swedes, turnips, leeks, white cabbage, spring  onions, carrots, Jerusalem artichokes, parsnips, and Brussels sprouts (if you  can face any more after Christmas).",Is Veganuary even affordable? ,https://www.theportugalnews.com/news/2022-12-29/is-veganuary-even-affordable/73382,portugalnews,www.theportugalnews.com,4,624
aef3b4249be4d790ca3ee3fb738bff40,"Many animals produce sound to communicate  with each other, and bats are no exception.They can produce a range of frequencies,  also known as the vocal range, that far exceeds vertebrates including humans. While researchers do not yet know the  meaning of all their sounds and songs, they are learning more and more about  how all these sounds are made.According to a new study of Daubenton’s  bats, for some sounds, they use the same technique as human death metal singers  and throat singing members of the Tuva people in Siberia and Mongolia.Researchers from the University of  Southern Denmark, led by Professor Coen Elemans, department of biology, have  for the first time filmed what goes on in a bat’s voice box (larynx) when it  produces sound. Prof Elemans, said: “We identified for  the first time what physical structures within the larynx oscillate to make  their different vocalisations. “For example, bats can make low frequency  calls, using their so-called ‘false vocal folds’ – like human death metal  singers do.”Together the normal vocal range for a bat  spans 7 octaves, the research team reports.“Remarkable range”Prof Elemans added: “That is remarkable.  Most mammals have a range of 3-4, and humans about 3. “Some human singers can reach a range of  4-5, but they are only very few. Well-known examples are Mariah Carey, Axl Rose  and Prince. “It turns out that bats surpass this  range by using different structures in their larynx.”False vocal folds are called so because  they look like vocal folds – tissues located in the voice box – but they are  not used in normal human speech and song. Only death metal growlers and throat singers  from a few cultures around the world use their false vocal folds like the bats. Humans move the vocal folds down so that  they oscillate together with the vocal folds.The researchers say growling sounds are  often produced when bats fly in or out from a densely packed roost. They do not know for sure what a growling  bat intends to communicate. “Some seem aggressive, some may be an  expression of annoyance, and some may have a very different function. “We don’t know yet”, said biologist and  study co-author Lasse Jakobsen from University of Southern Denmark.Bats hunt insects in complete darkness  using echolocation, and send out very short, very high frequency calls. They listen for echoes reflected from  objects in the surroundings to find and capture insects. Researchers say their findings reveal for  the first time how bats are able to make high frequency echolocation calls.They do so by vibrating very thin vocal  membranes – structures that humans also once had but were lost in our  evolution.

In this  sense, DECO calls for the creation of a Catastrophe Fund to protect owners  against these events.Credits: Unsplash; Author: Juan Manuel Sanchez;What are DECO's next steps?DECO will monitor consumers in their claims with  insurers and report any delays in the payment of compensation.In addition, DECO will also resume contact with the  Office of the Secretary of State for Tourism, Commerce, and Services, who, in  July, let us know that they were evaluating, along with the support of the  Directorate General of the Consumer, the viability of the Catastrophe Fund  proposed by DECO. ""It is clear that we cannot wait any longer for the  creation of this Fund,"" they said.
